In response, efforts have been made to align LLMs with human values and intent use. However, a particular type of adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged and continuously evolved to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on jailbreak prompts in the wild, with 6,387 prompts collected from four platforms over six months. Leveraging natural language processing technologies and graph-based community detection methods, we discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from public platforms to private ones, posing new challenges for LLM vendors in proactive detection. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 46,800 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Our experiments show that current LLMs and safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios. Particularly, we identify two highly effective jailbreak prompts which achieve 0.99 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and they have persisted online for over 100 days. Our work sheds light on the severe and evolving threat landscape of jailbreak prompts. We hope our study can facilitate the research community and LLM vendors in promoting safer and regulated LLMs.",1104d766527dead44a40532e8a89444d9cef5c65,Semantic Scholar,,,
fuzzllm a novel and universal fuzzing framework for proactively discovering jailbreak vulnerabilities in large language models,"['Dongyu Yao', 'Jianshu Zhang', 'Ian G.

While model owners can defend against individual jailbreak prompts through safety training strategies, this relatively passive approach struggles to handle the broader category of similar jailbreaks. To tackle this issue, we introduce FuzzLLM, an automated fuzzing framework designed to proactively test and discover jailbreak vulnerabilities in LLMs. We utilize templates to capture the structural integrity of a prompt and isolate key features of a jailbreak class as constraints. By integrating different base classes into powerful combo attacks and varying the elements of constraints and prohibited questions, FuzzLLM enables efficient testing with reduced manual effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate FuzzLLM's effectiveness and comprehensiveness in vulnerability discovery across various LLMs.",3c784cd3150a359e269c70cfbadd18774d66055d,Semantic Scholar,,,
baseline defenses for adversarial attacks against aligned language models,"['Neel Jain', 'Avi Schwarzschild', 'Yuxin Wen', 'Gowthami Somepalli', 'John Kirchenbauer', 'Ping-yeh Chiang', 'Micah Goldblum', 'Aniruddha Saha', 'Jonas Geiping', 'Tom Goldstein']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00614,2023-09-01,,"As Large Language Models quickly become ubiquitous, it becomes critical to understand their security vulnerabilities. Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision? We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision.",3e30a7ac4886b28eb50151f58e14a1d698cccd0e,Semantic Scholar,,,
latent jailbreak a benchmark for evaluating text safety and output robustness of large language models,"['Huachuan Qiu', 'Shuai Zhang', 'Anqi Li', 'Hongliang He', 'Zhenzhong Lan']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08487,2023-07-17,,"Considerable research efforts have been devoted to ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values and generate safe text. However, an excessive focus on sensitivity to certain topics can compromise the model's robustness in following instructions, thereby impacting its overall performance in completing tasks. Previous benchmarks for jailbreaking LLMs have primarily focused on evaluating the safety of the models without considering their robustness. In this paper, we propose a benchmark that assesses both the safety and robustness of LLMs, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach. To comprehensively study text safety and output robustness, we introduce a latent jailbreak prompt dataset, each involving malicious instruction embedding. Specifically, we instruct the model to complete a regular task, such as translation, with the text to be translated containing malicious instructions. To further analyze safety and robustness, we design a hierarchical annotation framework. We present a systematic analysis of the safety and robustness of LLMs regarding the position of explicit normal instructions, word replacements (verbs in explicit normal instructions, target groups in malicious instructions, cue words for explicit normal instructions), and instruction replacements (different explicit normal instructions). Our results demonstrate that current LLMs not only prioritize certain instruction verbs but also exhibit varying jailbreak rates for different instruction verbs in explicit normal instructions.

defending against alignmentbreaking attacks via robustly aligned llm,"['Bochuan Cao', 'Yu Cao', 'Lu Lin', 'Jinghui Chen']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14348,2023-09-18,,"Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements and are now widely used across various domains. Unfortunately, there has been a rising concern that LLMs can be misused to generate harmful or malicious content. Though a line of research has focused on aligning LLMs with human values and preventing them from producing inappropriate content, such alignments are usually vulnerable and can be bypassed by alignment-breaking attacks via adversarially optimized or handcrafted jailbreaking prompts. In this work, we introduce a Robustly Aligned LLM (RA-LLM) to defend against potential alignment-breaking attacks. RA-LLM can be directly constructed upon an existing aligned LLM with a robust alignment checking function, without requiring any expensive retraining or fine-tuning process of the original LLM. Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical analysis for RA-LLM to verify its effectiveness in defending against alignment-breaking attacks. Through real-world experiments on open-source large language models, we demonstrate that RA-LLM can successfully defend against both state-of-the-art adversarial prompts and popular handcrafted jailbreaking prompts by reducing their attack success rates from nearly 100% to around 10% or less.",cd29c25c489562b409a60f83365f93f33ee1a0a1,Semantic Scholar,,,
gptfuzzer red teaming large language models with autogenerated jailbreak prompts,"['Jiahao Yu', 'Xingwei Lin', 'Zheng Yu', 'Xinyu Xing']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10253,2023-09-19,,"Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced tremendous popularity and are widely used from casual conversations to AI-driven programming. However, despite their considerable success, LLMs are not entirely reliable and can give detailed guidance on how to conduct harmful or illegal activities. While safety measures can reduce the risk of such outputs, adversarial jailbreak attacks can still exploit LLMs to produce harmful content. These jailbreak templates are typically manually crafted, making large-scale testing challenging. In this paper, we introduce GPTFuzz, a novel black-box jailbreak fuzzing framework inspired by the AFL fuzzing framework. Instead of manual engineering, GPTFuzz automates the generation of jailbreak templates for red-teaming LLMs. At its core, GPTFuzz starts with human-written templates as initial seeds, then mutates them to produce new templates. We detail three key components of GPTFuzz: a seed selection strategy for balancing efficiency and variability, mutate operators for creating semantically equivalent or similar sentences, and a judgment model to assess the success of a jailbreak attack. We evaluate GPTFuzz against various commercial and open-source LLMs, including ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Vicuna, under diverse attack scenarios. Our results indicate that GPTFuzz consistently produces jailbreak templates with a high success rate, surpassing human-crafted templates. Remarkably, GPTFuzz achieves over 90% attack success rates against ChatGPT and Llama-2 models, even with suboptimal initial seed templates. We anticipate that GPTFuzz will be instrumental for researchers and practitioners in examining LLM robustness and will encourage further exploration into enhancing LLM safety.",d4177489596748e43aa571f59556097f2cc4c8be,Semantic Scholar,,,

Such LLMs are freely available to students. In the context of CTF exercises in the classroom, this raises concerns about academic integrity. Educators must understand LLMs' capabilities to modify their teaching to accommodate generative AI assistance. This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs, particularly in the realm of CTF challenges and questions. Here we evaluate three popular LLMs, OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing. First, we assess the LLMs' question-answering performance on five Cisco certifications with varying difficulty levels. Next, we qualitatively study the LLMs' abilities in solving CTF challenges to understand their limitations. We report on the experience of using the LLMs for seven test cases in all five types of CTF challenges. In addition, we demonstrate how jailbreak prompts can bypass and break LLMs' ethical safeguards.

autodan generating stealthy jailbreak prompts on aligned large language models,"['Xiaogeng Liu', 'Nan Xu', 'Muhao Chen', 'Chaowei Xiao']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04451,2023-10-03,,"The aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful language understanding and decision-making tools that are created through extensive alignment with human feedback. However, these large models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to elicit malicious outputs that should not be given by aligned LLMs. Investigating jailbreak prompts can lead us to delve into the limitations of LLMs and further guide us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak techniques suffer from either (1) scalability issues, where attacks heavily rely on manual crafting of prompts, or (2) stealthiness problems, as attacks depend on token-based algorithms to generate prompts that are often semantically meaningless, making them susceptible to detection through basic perplexity testing. In light of these challenges, we intend to answer this question: Can we develop an approach that can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts? In this paper, we introduce AutoDAN, a novel jailbreak attack against aligned LLMs. AutoDAN can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts by the carefully designed hierarchical genetic algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoDAN not only automates the process while preserving semantic meaningfulness, but also demonstrates superior attack strength in cross-model transferability, and cross-sample universality compared with the baseline. Moreover, we also compare AutoDAN with perplexity-based defense methods and show that AutoDAN can bypass them effectively.",f3f23f7f9f5369aade19f20bc5d028cce7b9c9aa,Semantic Scholar,,,

decomposed prompting a modular approach for solving complex tasks,"['Tushar Khot', 'H.

However, this approach struggles as the task complexity increases or when the individual reasoning steps of the task themselves are hard to learn, especially when embedded in more complex tasks. To address this, we propose Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve complex tasks by decomposing them (via prompting) into simpler sub-tasks that can be delegated to a library of prompting-based LLMs dedicated to these sub-tasks. This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for its specific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired. We show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it to outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. On symbolic reasoning tasks, we can further decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, we can recursively decompose the task into the same task but with smaller inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach the sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain multi-hop QA, we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within our decomposition framework, leading to improved performance on both tasks.

blsp bootstrapping languagespeech pretraining via behavior alignment of continuation writing,"['Chen Wang', 'Minpeng Liao', 'Zhongqiang Huang', 'Jinliang Lu', 'Junhong Wu', 'Yuchen Liu', 'Chengqing Zong', 'Jiajun Zhang']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00916,2023-09-02,,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in extending their remarkable language capabilities to speech. However, modality alignment between speech and text still remains an open problem. Current solutions can be categorized into two strategies. One is a cascaded approach where outputs (tokens or states) of a separately trained speech recognition system are used as inputs for LLMs, which limits their potential in modeling alignment between speech and text. The other is an end-to-end approach that relies on speech instruction data, which is very difficult to collect in large quantities. In this paper, we address these issues and propose the BLSP approach that Bootstraps Language-Speech Pre-training via behavior alignment of continuation writing. We achieve this by learning a lightweight modality adapter between a frozen speech encoder and an LLM, ensuring that the LLM exhibits the same generation behavior regardless of the modality of input: a speech segment or its transcript. The training process can be divided into two steps. The first step prompts an LLM to generate texts with speech transcripts as prefixes, obtaining text continuations. In the second step, these continuations are used as supervised signals to train the modality adapter in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate that this straightforward process can extend the capabilities of LLMs to speech, enabling speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language understanding, and speech conversation, even in zero-shot cross-lingual scenarios.",204fd6c5e247c477d607f507ee01d94a8dbd408f,Semantic Scholar,,,

Schiele', 'Hilde Kuehne']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04900,2023-10-07,,"Instructional videos are an excellent source for learning multimodal representations by leveraging video-subtitle pairs extracted with automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) from the audio signal in the videos. However, in contrast to human-annotated captions, both speech and subtitles naturally differ from the visual content of the videos and thus provide only noisy supervision for multimodal learning. As a result, large-scale annotation-free web video training data remains sub-optimal for training text-video models. In this work, we propose to leverage the capability of large language models (LLMs) to obtain fine-grained video descriptions aligned with videos. Specifically, we prompt an LLM to create plausible video descriptions based on ASR narrations of the video for a large-scale instructional video dataset. To this end, we introduce a prompting method that is able to take into account a longer text of subtitles, allowing us to capture context beyond a single sentence. To align the captions to the video temporally, we prompt the LLM to generate timestamps for each produced caption based on the subtitles. In this way, we obtain human-style video captions at scale without human supervision. We apply our method to the subtitles of the HowTo100M dataset, creating a new large-scale dataset, HowToCaption. Our evaluation shows that the resulting captions not only significantly improve the performance over many different benchmark datasets for text-video retrieval but also lead to a disentangling of textual narration from the audio, boosting performance in text-video-audio tasks.",24dd96da6f700f57132713aeb5e9b06905abab5d,Semantic Scholar,,,
algo synthesizing algorithmic programs with generated oracle verifiers,"['Kexun Zhang', 'Danqing Wang', 'Jingtao Xia', 'William Yang Wang', 'Lei Li']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14591,2023-05-24,,"Large language models (LLMs) excel at implementing code from functionality descriptions but struggle with algorithmic problems that require not only implementation but also identification of the suitable algorithm. Moreover, LLM-generated programs lack guaranteed correctness and require human verification. To address these challenges, we propose ALGO, a framework that synthesizes Algorithmic programs with LLM-Generated Oracles to guide the generation and verify their correctness. ALGO first generates a reference oracle by prompting an LLM to exhaustively enumerate all the combinations of relevant variables. This oracle is then utilized to guide an arbitrary search strategy in exploring the algorithm space and to verify the synthesized algorithms. Our study shows that the LLM-generated oracles are correct for 88% of the cases. With the oracles as verifiers, ALGO can be integrated with any existing code generation model in a model-agnostic manner to enhance its performance. Experiments show that when equipped with ALGO, we achieve an 8x better one-submission pass rate over the Codex model and a 2.6x better one-submission pass rate over CodeT, the current state-of-the-art model on CodeContests.

We evaluated the transfer learning ability of the prompt-based learning algorithms in a cross-institution setting. We also assessed the few-shot learning ability. Results and Conclusion When LLMs are unfrozen, GatorTron-3.9B with soft prompting achieves the best strict F1-scores of 0.9118 and 0.8604 for concept extraction, outperforming the traditional fine-tuning and hard prompt-based models by 0.6~3.1% and 1.2~2.9%, respectively; GatorTron-345M with soft prompting achieves the best F1-scores of 0.8332 and 0.7488 for end-to-end relation extraction, outperforming the other two models by 0.2~2% and 0.6~11.7%, respectively. When LLMs are frozen, small (i.e., 345 million parameters) LLMs have a big gap to be competitive with unfrozen models; scaling LLMs up to billions of parameters makes frozen LLMs competitive with unfrozen LLMs. For cross-institute evaluation, soft prompting with a frozen GatorTron-8.9B model achieved the best performance.

However, recent studies show that even the more advanced LLMs fail in scenarios that require reasoning over multiple objects or facts and making sequences of logical deductions. We propose a two-stage probabilistic inference paradigm, ThinkSum, which reasons over sets of objects or facts in a structured manner. In the first stage (Think – retrieval of associations), a LLM is queried in parallel over a set of phrases extracted from the prompt or an auxiliary model call. In the second stage (Sum – probabilistic inference or reasoning), the results of these queries are aggregated to make the final prediction. We demonstrate the possibilities and advantages of ThinkSum on the BIG-bench suite of LLM evaluation tasks, achieving improvements over the state of the art using GPT-family models on thirteen difficult tasks, often with far smaller model variants. We also compare and contrast ThinkSum with other proposed modifications to direct prompting of LLMs, such as variants of chain-of-thought prompting. Our results suggest that because the probabilistic inference in ThinkSum is performed outside of calls to the LLM, ThinkSum is less sensitive to prompt design, yields more interpretable predictions, and can be flexibly combined with latent variable models to extract structured knowledge from LLMs. Overall, our proposed paradigm represents a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",370cea8b4220917f45a69358c0303df71f5063c7,Semantic Scholar,,,

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag extraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core insight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract and reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR, ASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set that reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT predicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting LLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs tagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for zero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with the tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is well noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular framework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence embedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any more advanced one you want. TagGPT is applicable for various modalities of data in modern social media and showcases strong generalization ability to a wide range of applications.

The research community has conducted several pilot studies to apply LLMs to machine translation tasks and evaluate their performance from diverse perspectives. However, previous research has primarily focused on the LLM itself and has not explored human intervention in the inference process of LLM. The characteristics of LLM, such as in-context learning and prompt engineering, closely mirror human cognitive abilities in language tasks, offering an intuitive solution for human-in-the-loop generation. In this study, we propose a human-in-the-loop pipeline that guides LLMs to produce customized outputs with revision instructions. The pipeline initiates by prompting the LLM to produce a draft translation, followed by the utilization of automatic retrieval or human feedback as supervision signals to enhance the LLM’s translation through in-context learning. The human-machine interactions generated in this pipeline are also stored in an external database to expand the in-context retrieval database, enabling us to leverage human supervision in an offline setting. We evaluate the proposed pipeline using the GPT-3.5-turbo API on five domain-specific benchmarks for German-English translation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pipeline in tailoring in-domain translations and improving translation performance compared to direct translation instructions. Additionally, we discuss the experimental results from the following perspectives: 1) the effectiveness of different in-context retrieval methods; 2) the construction of a retrieval database under low-resource scenarios; 3) the observed differences across selected domains; 4) the quantitative analysis of sentence-level and word-level statistics; and 5) the qualitative analysis of representative translation cases.",4950bf6f873ba1409a7bbad25cf5c93c8f833453,Semantic Scholar,,,

These programs can be directly verified by running on the observed examples and generalized to novel inputs. Because of the prohibitive cost of generation with state-of-the-art LLMs, we consider a middle step to filter the set of hypotheses that will be implemented into programs: we either ask the LLM to summarize into a smaller set of hypotheses, or ask human annotators to select a subset of the hypotheses. We verify our pipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive reasoning benchmark, its variant 1D-ARC, and string transformation dataset SyGuS. On a random 40-problem subset of ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves 27.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming the direct prompting baseline (accuracy of 12.5%). With the minimal human input of selecting from LLM-generated candidates, the performance is boosted to 37.5%. (And we argue this is a lower bound on the performance of our approach without filtering.) Our ablation studies show that abstract hypothesis generation and concrete program representations are both beneficial for LLMs to perform inductive reasoning tasks.",4cf527e9e0d68e3fc16d39fbcdb3869cd3ccf60f,Semantic Scholar,,,
pearl prompting large language models to plan and execute actions over long documents,"['Simeng Sun', 'Y.

However, it remains unclear how to apply such methods to reason over long input documents, in which both the decomposition and the output of each intermediate step are non-trivial to obtain. In this work, we propose PEARL, a prompting framework to improve reasoning over long documents, which consists of three stages: action mining, plan formulation, and plan execution. More specifically, given a question about a long document, PEARL decomposes the question into a sequence of actions (e.g., SUMMARIZE, FIND_EVENT, FIND_RELATION) and then executes them over the document to obtain the answer. Each stage of PEARL is implemented via zero-shot or few-shot prompting of LLMs (in our work, GPT-4) with minimal human input. We evaluate PEARL on a challenging subset of the QuALITY dataset, which contains questions that require complex reasoning over long narrative texts. PEARL outperforms zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting on this dataset, and ablation experiments show that each stage of PEARL is critical to its performance. Overall, PEARL is a first step towards leveraging LLMs to reason over long documents.",4ee96f0757e517928590a2300af5d40ba768a5a7,Semantic Scholar,,,

Mining public opinion surveys (by Pew Research), we find that the opinions of a user and their demographics and ideologies are not mutual predictors. We use this insight to align LLMs by modeling both user opinions as well as user demographics and ideology, achieving up to 7 points accuracy gains in predicting public opinions from survey questions across a broad set of topics. In addition to the typical approach of prompting LLMs with demographics and ideology, we discover that utilizing the most relevant past opinions from individual users enables the model to predict user opinions more accurately.",5db0f55332839c408e3049cea1a6ad48fefba70c,Semantic Scholar,,,

In order to increase the linguistic diversity of our system relative to the related previous work, we do not fine-tune the LLMs used by our system on existing TOD datasets; rather we use in-context learning to prompt the LLMs to generate robust and linguistically diverse output with the goal of simulating the behavior of human interlocutors. Unlike previous work, which sought to maximize goal success rate (GSR) as the primary metric of simulator performance, our goal is a system which achieves a GSR similar to that observed in human interactions with TOD systems. Using this approach, our current simulator is effectively able to interact with several TOD systems, especially on single-intent conversational goals, while generating lexically and syntactically diverse output relative to previous simulators that rely upon fine-tuned models. Finally, we collect a Human2Bot dataset of humans interacting with the same TOD systems with which we experimented in order to better quantify these achievements.",64e9e1686cf85db163f007a8621e2c1b24d86feb,Semantic Scholar,,,

Despite the complexity and importance of this task, it has yet to be meaningfully studied due to the challenges of evaluation: existing book-length summarization datasets (e.g., BookSum) are in the pretraining data of most public LLMs, and existing evaluation methods struggle to capture errors made by modern LLM summarizers. In this paper, we present the first study of the coherence of LLM-based book-length summarizers implemented via two prompting workflows: (1) hierarchically merging chunk-level summaries, and (2) incrementally updating a running summary. We obtain 1193 fine-grained human annotations on GPT-4 generated summaries of 100 recently-published books and identify eight common types of coherence errors made by LLMs. Because human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming, we develop an automatic metric, BooookScore, that measures the proportion of sentences in a summary that do not contain any of the identified error types. BooookScore has high agreement with human annotations and allows us to systematically evaluate the impact of many other critical parameters (e.g., chunk size, base LLM) while saving $15K and 500 hours in human evaluation costs. We find that closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2 produce summaries with higher BooookScore than the oft-repetitive ones generated by LLaMA 2. Incremental updating yields lower BooookScore but higher level of detail than hierarchical merging, a trade-off sometimes preferred by human annotators.

Specifically, we tackle speech-intent classification task, where a high word-error-rate can limit the LLM's ability to understand the spoken intent. Instead of chasing a high accuracy by designing complex or specialized architectures regardless of deployment costs, we seek to answer how far we can go without substantially changing the underlying ASR and LLM, which can potentially be shared by multiple unrelated tasks. To this end, we propose prompting the LLM with an n-best list of ASR hypotheses instead of only the error-prone 1-best hypothesis. We explore prompt-engineering to explain the concept of n-best lists to the LLM; followed by the finetuning of Low-Rank Adapters on the downstream tasks. Our approach using n-best lists proves to be effective on a device-directed speech detection task as well as on a keyword spotting task, where systems using n-best list prompts outperform those using 1-best ASR hypothesis; thus paving the way for an efficient method to exploit ASR uncertainty via LLMs for speech-based applications.",72fb75f7c38a83424308c8205bb36cd88995494b,Semantic Scholar,,,

Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling.Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones.We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women.

Unlike prior studies focusing on adapting either the retriever or the reader, our approach pays attention to the adaptation of the search query itself, for there is inevitably a gap between the input text and the needed knowledge in retrieval. We first prompt an LLM to generate the query, then use a web search engine to retrieve contexts. Furthermore, to better align the query to the frozen modules, we propose a trainable scheme for our pipeline. A small language model is adopted as a trainable rewriter to cater to the black-box LLM reader. The rewriter is trained using the feedback of the LLM reader by reinforcement learning. Evaluation is conducted on downstream tasks, open-domain QA and multiple-choice QA. Experiments results show consistent performance improvement, indicating that our framework is proven effective and scalable, and brings a new framework for retrieval-augmented LLM.",f743287be3ced6757de7ecb26d03815b22cd737b,Semantic Scholar,,,

Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising results, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems. One common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem library during the whole theorem proving process. However, as we all know, creating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but crucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper results. In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill library containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs used in theorem proving. By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover enables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to create new skills during the proving process. These skills are further evolved (by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale. Modular and reusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling increasingly intricate mathematical problems. Moreover, the learned library further bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it easier to impute missing steps. LEGO-Prover advances the state-of-the-art pass rate on miniF2F-valid (48.0% to 57.0%) and miniF2F-test (45.5% to 47.1%). During the proving process, LEGO-Prover also manages to generate over 20,000 skills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library. Our ablation study indicates that these newly added skills are indeed helpful for proving theorems, resulting in an improvement from a success rate of 47.1% to 50.4%.

This prototyping practice is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people. Unfortunately, many challenges do not arise until a system is populated at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments to the design before the system falls prey to such challenges? We introduce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that generates a breadth of realistic social interactions that may emerge when a social computing system is populated. Social simulacra take as input the designer’s description of a community’s design—goal, rules, and member personas—and produce as output an instance of that design with simulated behavior, including posts, replies, and anti-social behaviors. We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that they enable exploration of “what if?” scenarios where community members or moderators intervene. To power social simulacra, we contribute techniques for prompting a large language model to generate thousands of distinct community members and their social interactions with each other; these techniques are enabled by the observation that large language models’ training data already includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on social media platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants are often unable to distinguish social simulacra from actual community behavior and that social computing designers successfully refine their social computing designs when using social simulacra.",49b499598a8864eee55ab264fc16a5bf8d2f87ef,Semantic Scholar,,,

Despite the severity of these vulnerabilities, no existing work has been conducted for a systematic investigation of them. This leaves a great challenge on how to detect vulnerabilities in frameworks as well as LLM-integrated apps in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we present two novel strategies, including 1) a static analysis-based tool called LLMSmith to scan the source code of the framework to detect potential RCE vulnerabilities and 2) a prompt-based automated testing approach to verify the vulnerability in LLM-integrated web apps. We discovered 13 vulnerabilities in 6 frameworks, including 12 RCE vulnerabilities and 1 arbitrary file read/write vulnerability. 11 of them are confirmed by the framework developers, resulting in the assignment of 7 CVE IDs. After testing 51 apps, we found vulnerabilities in 17 apps, 16 of which are vulnerable to RCE and 1 to SQL injection. We responsibly reported all 17 issues to the corresponding developers and received acknowledgments. Furthermore, we amplify the attack impact beyond achieving RCE by allowing attackers to exploit other app users (e.g. app responses hijacking, user API key leakage) without direct interaction between the attacker and the victim.

Automatically finding the optimal prompt for each task, however, is challenging. Most existing work resorts to tuning *soft* prompts (e.g., embeddings) which fall short of interpretability, reusability across LMs, and applicability when gradients are not accessible. *Discrete* prompts, on the other hand, are difficult to optimize, and are often created by “enumeration (e.g., paraphrasing)-then-selection” heuristics that do not explore the prompt space systematically. This paper proposes RLPrompt, an efficient discrete prompt optimization approach with reinforcement learning (RL). RLPrompt formulates a parameter-efficient policy network that generates the optimized discrete prompt after training with reward. To harness the complex and stochastic reward signals from the large LM environment, we incorporate effective reward stabilization that substantially enhances training efficiency. RLPrompt is flexibly applicable to different types of LMs, such as masked (e.g., BERT) and left-to-right models (e.g., GPTs), for both classification and generation tasks. Experiments on few-shot classification and unsupervised text style transfer show superior performance over a wide range of existing fine-tuning or prompting methods.

how does prompt engineering affect chatgpt performance on unsupervised entity resolution,"['Khanin Sisaengsuwanchai', 'Navapat Nananukul', 'M.

Traditional ER solutions required considerable manual expertise, including feature engineering, as well as identification and curation of training data. In many instances, such techniques are highly dependent on the domain. With recent advent in large language models (LLMs), there is an opportunity to make ER much more seamless and domain-independent. However, it is also well known that LLMs can pose risks, and that the quality of their outputs can depend on so-called prompt engineering. Unfortunately, a systematic experimental study on the effects of different prompting methods for addressing ER, using LLMs like ChatGPT, has been lacking thus far.

Prompts can be created manually as natural language instructions or generated automatically as either natural language instructions or vector representations. Prompt engineering enables the ability to perform predictions based solely on prompts without updating model parameters, and the easier application of large pre-trained models in real-world tasks. In past years, Prompt engineering has been well-studied in natural language processing. Recently, it has also been intensively studied in vision-language modeling. However, there is currently a lack of a systematic overview of prompt engineering on pre-trained vision-language models. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of cutting-edge research in prompt engineering on three types of vision-language models: multimodal-to-text generation models ( e.g., Flamingo), image-text matching models ( e.g., CLIP), and text-to-image generation models ( e.g., Stable Diffusion). For each type of model, a brief model summary, prompting methods, prompting-based applications, and the corresponding responsibility and integrity issues are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the commonalities and differences between prompting on vision-language models, language models, and vision models are also discussed.

OCL can provide precision and conciseness to UML models. Nevertheless, the unfamiliar syntax of OCL has hindered its adoption by software practitioners. LLMs, such as GPT-3, have made significant progress in many NLP tasks, such as text generation and semantic parsing. Similarly, researchers have improved on the downstream tasks by fine-tuning LLMs for the target task. Codex, a GPT-3 descendant by OpenAI, has been fine-tuned on publicly available code from GitHub and has proven the ability to generate code in many programming languages, powering the AI-pair programmer Copilot. One way to take advantage of Codex is to engineer prompts for the target downstream task. In this paper, we investigate the reliability of the OCL constraints generated by Codex from natural language specifications. To achieve this, we compiled a dataset of 15 UML models and 168 specifications from various educational resources. We manually crafted a prompt template with slots to populate with the UML information and the target task in the prefix format to complete the template with the generated OCL constraint. We used both zero- and few-shot learning methods in the experiments. The evaluation is reported by measuring the syntactic validity and the execution accuracy metrics of the generated OCL constraints. Moreover, to get insight into how close or natural the generated OCL constraints are compared to human-written ones, we measured the cosine similarity between the sentence embedding of the correctly generated and human-written OCL constraints. Our findings suggest that by enriching the prompts with the UML information of the models and enabling few-shot learning, the reliability of the generated OCL constraints increases.

This is subsequently used as a reward function to fine-tune a generative language model via reinforcement learning. However, simply fine-tuning a generative language model with a contrastive reward model does not always reliably result in a story generation system capable of generating stories that meet user preferences.

In this paper, we introduce Multi-Method Self-Training (MMST), where one method is trained on the filtered outputs of another, allowing us to augment the strengths and ameliorate the weaknesses of each method. Using a 176B parameter model trained on both language and code, we show that MMST can 1) improve the less performant method (up to 30%) making the model easier to use, 2) improve the more performant method (up to 32.2%) making the model more performant, and 3) improve the performance of related but distinct tasks (up to 10.3%) by improving the ability of the model to generate rationales. We then conduct ablation analyses to explore why MMST works. We show that MMST generates more data than traditional self-training, but the improvement in performance is driven by the use of multiple methods. We also analyze prompt-engineering and anti-correlated performance between methods as means of making MMST more effective.

However, to attain optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes. Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient method for prompt learning.

Current detection mechanisms are limited by their inability to address more covert backdoor strategies, such as style-based attacks. In this work, we propose an innovative test-time poisoned sample detection framework that hinges on the interpretability of model predictions, grounded in the semantic meaning of inputs. We contend that triggers (e.g., infrequent words) are not supposed to fundamentally alter the underlying semantic meanings of poisoned samples as they want to stay stealthy. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that while the model's predictions for paraphrased clean samples should remain stable, predictions for poisoned samples should revert to their true labels upon the mutations applied to triggers during the paraphrasing process. We employ ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art large language model, as our paraphraser and formulate the trigger-removal task as a prompt engineering problem. We adopt fuzzing, a technique commonly used for unearthing software vulnerabilities, to discover optimal paraphrase prompts that can effectively eliminate triggers while concurrently maintaining input semantics.

Could AI chatbots be an effective tool for anticipating public opinion on controversial issues to the extent that they could be used by campaigns, interest groups, and polling firms? We have developed a prompt engineering methodology for eliciting human-like survey responses from ChatGPT, which simulate the response to a policy question of a person described by a set of demographic factors, and produce both an ordinal numeric response score and a textual justification. We execute large scale experiments, querying for thousands of simulated responses at a cost far lower than human surveys.

The Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR) provides a symbolic generative model of both human success and failure in thinking, across propositional, quantified, and probabilistic reasoning, as well as decision-making. We presented GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 with 61 central inference and judgment problems from a recent book-length presentation of ETR, consisting of experimentally verified data-points on human judgment and extrapolated data-points predicted by ETR, with correct inference patterns as well as fallacies and framing effects (the ETR61 benchmark).

GPT-3 showed evidence of ETR-predicted outputs for 59% of these examples, rising to 77% in GPT-3.5 and 75% in GPT-4. Remarkably, the production of human-like fallacious judgments increased from 18% in GPT-3 to 33% in GPT-3.5 and 34% in GPT-4. This suggests that larger and more advanced LLMs may develop a tendency toward more human-like mistakes, as relevant thought patterns are inherent in human-produced training data. According to ETR, the same fundamental patterns are involved both in successful and unsuccessful ordinary reasoning, so that the'bad'cases could paradoxically be learned from the'good'cases. We further present preliminary evidence that ETR-inspired prompt engineering could reduce instances of these mistakes.",45c46687bc8d2dbdea6f92fc14d4dc7a548ddd12,Semantic Scholar,,,

However, zero-shot nuclei detection on H\&E images via VLPMs remains underexplored. The large gap between medical images and the web-originated text-image pairs used for pre-training makes it a challenging task. In this paper, we attempt to explore the potential of the object-level VLPM, Grounded Language-Image Pre-training (GLIP) model, for zero-shot nuclei detection. Concretely, an automatic prompts design pipeline is devised based on the association binding trait of VLPM and the image-to-text VLPM BLIP, avoiding empirical manual prompts engineering. We further establish a self-training framework, using the automatically designed prompts to generate the preliminary results as pseudo labels from GLIP and refine the predicted boxes in an iterative manner. Our method achieves a remarkable performance for label-free nuclei detection, surpassing other comparison methods.

However, it’s worth noting that BigCloneBench, originally not designed for semantic clone detection, presents several limitations that hinder its suitability as a comprehensive training dataset for this specific purpose. Furthermore, CLCDSA dataset suffers from a lack of reusable examples aligning with real-world software systems, rendering it inadequate for cross-language clone detection approaches. In this work, we present a comprehensive semantic clone and cross-language clone benchmark, GPTCloneBench 1 by exploiting SemanticCloneBench and OpenAI’s GPT-3 model. In particular, using code fragments from SemanticCloneBench as sample inputs along with appropriate prompt engineering for GPT-3 model, we generate semantic and cross-language clones for these specific fragments and then conduct a combination of extensive manual analysis, tool-assisted filtering, functionality testing and automated validation in building the benchmark. From 79,928 clone pairs of GPT-3 output, we created a benchmark with 37,149 true semantic clone pairs, 19,288 false semantic pairs(Type-1/Type-2), and 20,770 cross-language clones across four languages (Java, C, C#, and Python).

A key difference is that we distill knowledge symbolically–as text–in addition to the neural model. We distill only one aspect–the commonsense of a general language model teacher, allowing the student to be a different type, a commonsense model. Altogether, we show that careful prompt engineering and a separately trained critic model allow us to selectively distill high-quality causal commonsense from GPT-3, a general language model. Empirical results demonstrate that, for the first time, a human-authored commonsense knowledge graph is surpassed by our automatically distilled variant in all three criteria: quantity, quality, and diversity. In addition, it results in a neural commonsense model that surpasses the teacher model’s commonsense capabilities despite its 100x smaller size.

We formalize LLM systems as a class of discrete stochastic dynamical systems to explore prompt engineering through the lens of control theory. We investigate the reachable set of output token sequences $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ for which there exists a control input sequence $\mathbf u$ for each $\mathbf y \in R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ that steers the LLM to output $\mathbf y$ from initial state sequence $\mathbf x_0$. We offer analytic analysis on the limitations on the controllability of self-attention in terms of reachable set, where we prove an upper bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ as a function of the singular values of the parameter matrices. We present complementary empirical analysis on the controllability of a panel of LLMs, including Falcon-7b, Llama-7b, and Falcon-40b.

Existing benchmarks and datasets are meant to highlight the difference between the expected and the generated outcome, but do not take into account confounding variables (e.g., lines of code, number of tokens, prompt size) that equally influence the accuracy metrics. The fact remains that, when dealing with generative software tasks by LLMs, no benchmark is available to tell researchers how to quantify neither the causal effect of SE-based treatments nor the correlation of confounders to the model’s performance.

It is then natural to test their feasibility in solving the cohort recruitment task, which involves the classification of a given paragraph of medical text into disease label(s). However, when applied to knowledge-intensive problem settings such as medical text classification, where the LLMs are expected to understand the decision made by human experts and accurately identify the implied disease labels, the LLMs show a mediocre performance. A possible explanation is that, by only using the medical text, the LLMs neglect to use the rich context of additional information that languages afford.

Concretely, pseudo-demonstrations are constructed by (1) finding the nearest neighbors to the test input from the corpus and pairing them with random task labels, and (2) applying a set of techniques to reduce the amount of direct copying the model does from the resulting demonstrations. Evaluation on nine classification datasets shows that Z-ICL outperforms previous zero-shot methods by a significant margin, and is on par with in-context learning with labeled training data in the few-shot setting.

Recently, prompting-based methods have been widely explored among self-improvement methods owing to their effectiveness, efficiency, and convenience.

However, while various methods have been proposed to augment LLMs with retrieved knowledge and enhance the quality of code generation, the performance of these retrieval-based methods is limited by the strength of the retrievers used. In addition, while LLMs show great emergent ability, they still struggle to produce the correct code in one turn. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-step pipeline, called \autoknow, that leverages LLMs as both knowledge providers and self-reflective programmers. Unlike retrieval-based methods, \autoknow~obtains the knowledge from input prompts and generates intermediate code based on the generated knowledge. After that, \autoknow~asks LLM to act as an expert programmer to perform debugging for the generated code. This is achieved by receiving the error message from the interpreter, without requiring special test cases for correctness verification. We evaluate \autoknow~on three code generation datasets, including DS-1000 for data science code, HumanEval for software engineering code, and TransCoder for C++-to-Python translation. Our empirical experiments show that \autoknow~outperforms strong baselines by a significant margin on all datasets. We also conduct exhaustive analytical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the two stages of \autoknow, and find that both are superior to other prompting-based methods. Further scalability analysis demonstrates that \autoknow~can be adapted to other more advanced models, such as GPT-4, and bring consistent efficacy improvement.",eb36681fc4c5dfce4f3e05540fc92b007de278ca,Semantic Scholar,,,

To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based method, termed as PromptDFD, that allows us to take advantage of learned language priors, which effectively harmonizes the synthetic sentences to be semantically and grammatically correct. Specifically, PromptDFD leverages a pre-trained generative model to provide language priors and introduces a reinforced topic prompter to control data synthesis, making the generated samples thematically relevant and semantically plausible, and thus friendly to downstream tasks. As shown in our experiments, the proposed method substantially improves the synthesis quality and achieves considerable improvements on distillation performance.

We validate the votes using an auditing technique that checks if the explanation for a particular vote is reasonable using the LLM. We tested our methodology on 52 jokes in a crowd of four AI voters with different humour types: afﬁliative, self-enhancing, aggressive and self-defeating. Our results show that few-shot prompting leads to better results than zero-shot for the voting question. Personality induction showed that aggressive and self-defeating voters are signiﬁcantly more inclined to ﬁnd more jokes funny of a set of aggressive/self-defeating jokes than the afﬁliative and self-enhancing voters.

We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize sophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 and llama2-13b-chat to self-bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot prompting (generally by over 25% and 65%, respectively) and pipelines with expert-created demonstrations (by up to 5-46% and 16-40%, respectively). On top of that, DSPy programs compiled to open and relatively small LMs like 770M-parameter T5 and llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely on expert-written prompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5.

We then conduct two user studies on (1) the perceived correctness and helpfulness of the dialogues, and (2) the simulatability, i.e. how objectively helpful dialogical explanations are for humans in figuring out the model's predicted label when it's not shown. We found rationalization and feature attribution were helpful in explaining the model behavior.

Now if the few-shots also include “chain of thought” ($\mathcal{C}oT$) explanations, which are of the form problem-explanation-solution, LLMs will generate a “explained” solution, and perform even better. Recently an exciting, substantially better technique, self-consistency [1] ($\mathcal{S}-C$) has emerged, based on the intuition that there are many plausible explanations for the right solution; when the LLM is sampled repeatedly to generate a pool of explanation-solution pairs, for a given problem, the most frequently occurring solutions in the pool (ignoring the explanations) tend to be even more likely to be correct! Unfortunately, the use of this highly-performant $\mathcal{S}-C$ (or even $\mathcal{C}oT$) approach in software engineering settings is hampered by the lack of explanations; most software datasets lack explanations.

This ability can be leveraged to form a simple but powerful variation operator, i.e. to prompt a language model with a few text-based genotypes (such as code, plain-text sentences, or equations), and to parse its corresponding output as those genotypes' offspring. The promise of such language model crossover (which is simple to implement and can leverage many different open-source language models) is that it enables a simple mechanism to evolve semantically-rich text representations (with few domain-specific tweaks), and naturally benefits from current progress in language models. Experiments in this paper highlight the versatility of language-model crossover, through evolving binary bit-strings, sentences, equations, text-to-image prompts, and Python code.

Instead of attacking prompts in the use of LLMs, we propose a MathAttack model to attack MWP samples which are closer to the essence of security in solving math problems. Compared to traditional text adversarial attack, it is essential to preserve the mathematical logic of original MWPs during the attacking. To this end, we propose logical entity recognition to identify logical entries which are then frozen. Subsequently, the remaining text are attacked by adopting a word-level attacker. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset RobustMath to evaluate the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. Extensive experiments on our RobustMath and two another math benchmark datasets GSM8K and MultiAirth show that MathAttack could effectively attack the math solving ability of LLMs. In the experiments, we observe that (1) Our adversarial samples from higher-accuracy LLMs are also effective for attacking LLMs with lower accuracy (e.g., transfer from larger to smaller-size LLMs, or from few-shot to zero-shot prompts); (2) Complex MWPs (such as more solving steps, longer text, more numbers) are more vulnerable to attack; (3) We can improve the robustness of LLMs by using our adversarial samples in few-shot prompts.

In this work, we focus on improving the few-shot performance of prompt tuning by transferring knowledge from soft prompts of source tasks. Recognizing the good generalization capabilities of ensemble methods in low-data regime, we first experiment and show that a simple ensemble of model predictions based on different source prompts, outperforms existing multi-prompt knowledge transfer approaches such as source prompt fusion in the few-shot setting. Motivated by this observation, we further investigate model ensembles and propose Sample-specific Ensemble of Source Models (SESoM). SESoM learns to adjust the contribution of each source model for each target sample separately when ensembling source model outputs. Through this way, SESoM inherits the superior generalization of model ensemble approaches and simultaneously captures the sample-specific competence of each source prompt. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of eight NLP tasks using models of different scales (T5-{base, large, XL}) and find that SESoM consistently outperforms the existing models of the same as well as larger parametric scale by a large margin.",3d7d385d9ee75a286e8da27f7d3cf9f12651c899,Semantic Scholar,,,

We find that these code-writing LLMs can be re-purposed to write robot policy code, given natural language commands. Specifically, policy code can express functions or feedback loops that process perception outputs (e.g., from object detectors [2], [3]) and parameterize control primitive APIs. When provided as input several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed by corresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in new commands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy code respectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this way can write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii) generalize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g., velocities) to ambiguous descriptions (‘faster’) depending on context (i.e., behavioral commonsense).

We advocate the use of tool documentation, descriptions for the individual tool usage, over demonstrations. We substantiate our claim through three main empirical findings on 6 tasks across both vision and language modalities. First, on existing benchmarks, zero-shot prompts with only tool documentation are sufficient for eliciting proper tool usage, achieving performance on par with few-shot prompts. Second, on a newly collected realistic tool-use dataset with hundreds of available tool APIs, we show that tool documentation is significantly more valuable than demonstrations, with zero-shot documentation significantly outperforming few-shot without documentation.

Specifically, CoT pushes the performance of large language models in a few-shot setup by augmenting the prompts with intermediate steps. Despite impressive results across various tasks, the reasons behind their success have not been explored. This work uses counterfactual prompting to develop a deeper understanding of CoT-based few-shot prompting mechanisms in large language models. We first systematically identify and define the key components of a prompt: symbols, patterns, and text. Then, we devise and conduct an exhaustive set of experiments across four different tasks, by querying the model with counterfactual prompts where only one of these components is altered. Our experiments across three models (PaLM, GPT-3, and CODEX) reveal several surprising findings and brings into question the conventional wisdom around few-shot prompting. First, the presence of factual patterns in a prompt is practically immaterial to the success of CoT. Second, our results conclude that the primary role of intermediate steps may not be to facilitate learning how to solve a task. The intermediate steps are rather a beacon for the model to realize what symbols to replicate in the output to form a factual answer. Further, text imbues patterns with commonsense knowledge and meaning. Our empirical and qualitative analysis reveals that a symbiotic relationship between text and patterns explains the success of few-shot prompting: text helps extract commonsense from the question to help patterns, and patterns enforce task understanding and direct text generation.",4988b3d378b79eb8669112620baf1ff4e3e536fd,Semantic Scholar,,,

The recent advancements in the development of visiolinguistic (VL) transformers suggest some off-the-self implementations with encouraging results, which however we argue that can be further improved. To this end, we propose some knowledge-enhancement techniques towards improving the retrieval performance of VL transformers via the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as Knowledge Bases. More specifically, knowledge stored in LLMs is retrieved with the help of appropriate prompts in a zero-shot manner, achieving performance advancements. Moreover, we convert VWSD to a purely textual question-answering (QA) problem by considering generated image captions as multiple-choice candidate answers. Zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies are leveraged to explore the potential of such a transformation, while Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in the zero-shot setting is able to reveal the internal reasoning steps an LLM follows to select the appropriate candidate.

But on what tasks do language models fall short of average human-rater performance, and are those tasks actually unsolvable by current language models? In this work, we focus on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we call BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the average human-rater performance on 10 of the 23 tasks, and Codex (code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 tasks. Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further analysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH, finding that CoT enables emergent task performance on several BBH tasks with otherwise flat scaling curves.",663a41c866d49ce052801fbc88947d39764cad29,Semantic Scholar,,,

Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods such as'chain-of-thought'', which employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other benchmarks. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models.

We demonstrate that CoT explanations can be heavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs--e.g., by reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always'(A)'--which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations rationalizing those answers.

revisiting relation extraction in the era of large language models,"['Somin Wadhwa', 'Silvio Amir', 'Byron C. Wallace']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05003,2023-05-08,,"Relation extraction (RE) is the core NLP task of inferring semantic relationships between entities from text. Standard supervised RE techniques entail training modules to tag tokens comprising entity spans and then predict the relationship between them. Recent work has instead treated the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, linearizing relations between entities as target strings to be generated conditioned on the input. Here we push the limits of this approach, using larger language models (GPT-3 and Flan-T5 large) than considered in prior work and evaluating their performance on standard RE tasks under varying levels of supervision. We address issues inherent to evaluating generative approaches to RE by doing human evaluations, in lieu of relying on exact matching. Under this refined evaluation, we find that: (1) Few-shot prompting with GPT-3 achieves near SOTA performance, i.e., roughly equivalent to existing fully supervised models; (2) Flan-T5 is not as capable in the few-shot setting, but supervising and fine-tuning it with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style explanations (generated via GPT-3) yields SOTA results. We release this model as a new baseline for RE tasks.",97782a67971c4ff1a74bf07e82fe20b2c4bf86c4,Semantic Scholar,,,

However, we show that purely passive learning can in fact allow an agent to learn generalizable strategies for determining and using causal structures, as long as the agent can intervene at test time. We formally illustrate that learning a strategy of first experimenting, then seeking goals, can allow generalization from passive learning in principle. We then show empirically that agents trained via imitation on expert data can indeed generalize at test time to infer and use causal links which are never present in the training data; these agents can also generalize experimentation strategies to novel variable sets never observed in training. We then show that strategies for causal intervention and exploitation can be generalized from passive data even in a more complex environment with high-dimensional observations, with the support of natural language explanations. Explanations can even allow passive learners to generalize out-of-distribution from perfectly-confounded training data. Finally, we show that language models, trained only on passive next-word prediction, can generalize causal intervention strategies from a few-shot prompt containing examples of experimentation, together with explanations and reasoning. These results highlight the surprising power of passive learning of active causal strategies, and may help to understand the behaviors and capabilities of language models.",ce0154d9251f67c262512b6e598f3aa3ba9fe9a4,Semantic Scholar,,,

On the other hand, if we were to ask people about interests they pursue in their life, they might talk about their hobbies, like I just started learning the ukulele, or their relaxation routines, e.g., I like to watch Saturday Night Live, or I want to plant a vertical garden.

boosting lowdata instance segmentation by unsupervised pretraining with saliency prompt,"['Hao Li', 'Dingwen Zhang', 'Nian Liu', 'Lechao Cheng', 'Yalun Dai', 'Chaoxi Zhang', 'Xinggang Wang', 'Junwei Han']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01171,2023-02-02,,"Inspired by DETR variants, query-based end-to-end instance segmentation (QEIS) methods have recently outperformed CNN-based models on large-scale datasets. Yet they would lose efficacy when only a small amount of training data is available since it's hard for the crucial queries/kernels to learn localization and shape priors. To this end, this work offers a novel unsupervised pre-training solution for low-data regimes. Inspired by the recent success of the Prompting technique, we introduce a new pre-training method that boosts QEIS models by giving Saliency Prompt for queries/kernels. Our method contains three parts: 1) Saliency Masks Proposal is responsible for generating pseudo masks from unlabeled images based on the saliency mechanism. 2) Prompt-Kernel Matching transfers pseudo masks into prompts and injects the corresponding localization and shape priors to the best-matched kernels. 3) Kernel Supervision is applied to supply supervision at the kernel level for robust learning. From a practical perspective, our pre-training method helps QEIS models achieve a similar convergence speed and comparable performance with CNN-based models in low-data regimes. Experimental results show that our method significantly boosts several QEIS models on three datasets.11Code: https://github.com/lifuguan/saliency.prompt",29965a1efc21a637e03a5e0a869d77eca77f5085,Semantic Scholar,,,

Specifically, the strongest approaches can consistently reach system ranking correlations of over 0.86 with the full rankings over a variety of measures. Meanwhile, the approach substantially increases the reliability of t-tests due to filling holes in relevance assessments, giving researchers more confidence in results they find to be significant.

VP can reprogram a fixed, pre-trained source model to accomplish downstream tasks in the target domain by simply incorporating universal prompts (in terms of input perturbation patterns) into downstream data points. Yet, it remains elusive why VP stays effective even given a ruleless label mapping (LM) between the source classes and the target classes. Inspired by the above, we ask: How is LM interrelated with VP? And how to exploit such a relationship to improve its accuracy on target tasks? We peer into the influence of LM on VP and provide an affirmative answer that a better ‘quality’ of LM (assessed by mapping precision and explanation) can consistently improve the effectiveness of VP. This is in contrast to the prior art where the factor of LM was missing. To optimize LM, we propose a new VP framework, termed ILM-VP (iterative label mapping-based visual prompting), which automatically re-maps the source labels to the target labels and progressively improves the target task accuracy of VP. Further, when using a contrastive language-image pretrained (CLIP) model for VP, we propose to integrate an LM process to assist the text prompt selection of CLIP and to improve the target task accuracy.

adaptivesolver framework for dynamic strategy selection in large language model reasoning,"['Jianpeng Zhou', 'Wanjun Zhong', 'Yanlin Wang', 'Jiahai Wang']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01446,2023-10-01,,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are showcasing impressive ability in handling complex reasoning tasks. In real-world situations, problems often span a spectrum of complexities. Humans inherently adjust their problem-solving approaches based on task complexity. However, most methodologies that leverage LLMs tend to adopt a uniform approach: utilizing consistent models, prompting methods, and degrees of problem decomposition, regardless of the problem complexity. Inflexibility of them can bring unnecessary computational overhead or sub-optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce an Adaptive-Solver framework. It strategically modulates solving strategies based on the difficulties of the problems. Given an initial solution, the framework functions with two primary modules. The initial evaluation module assesses the adequacy of the current solution. If improvements are needed, the subsequent adaptation module comes into play. Within this module, three key adaptation strategies are employed: (1) Model Adaptation: Switching to a stronger LLM when a weaker variant is inadequate. (2) Prompting Method Adaptation: Alternating between different prompting techniques to suit the problem's nuances. (3) Decomposition Granularity Adaptation: Breaking down a complex problem into more fine-grained sub-questions to enhance solvability. Through such dynamic adaptations, our framework not only enhances computational efficiency but also elevates the overall performance. This dual-benefit ensures both the efficiency of the system for simpler tasks and the precision required for more complex questions. Experimental results from complex reasoning tasks reveal that the prompting method adaptation and decomposition granularity adaptation enhance performance across all tasks. Furthermore, the model adaptation approach significantly reduces API costs (up to 50%) while maintaining superior performance.",5076bbbf831a92174c9cc1b347bd0584560435fc,Semantic Scholar,,,

We examine the backward reasoning capabilities of LLMs on Math Word Problems (MWPs): given a mathematical question and its answer, with some details omitted from the question, can LLMs effectively retrieve the missing information? In this paper, we formally define the backward reasoning task on math word problems and modify three datasets to evaluate this task: GSM8k, SVAMP and MultiArith. Our findings show a significant drop in the accuracy of models on backward reasoning compared to forward reasoning across four SOTA LLMs (GPT4, GPT3.5, PaLM-2, and LLaMa-2). Utilizing the specific format of this task, we propose three novel techniques that improve performance: Rephrase reformulates the given problem into a forward reasoning problem, PAL-Tools combines the idea of Program-Aided LLMs to produce a set of equations that can be solved by an external solver, and Check your Work exploits the availability of natural verifier of high accuracy in the forward direction, interleaving solving and verification steps. Finally, realizing that each of our base methods correctly solves a different set of problems, we propose a novel Bayesian formulation for creating an ensemble over these base methods aided by a verifier to further boost the accuracy by a significant margin.

We identify that specific templates significantly influence VQA outcomes, underscoring the need for strategic template selection. Another pivotal aspect of our study is augmenting VLMs with image captions, providing them with additional visual cues alongside direct image features in VQA tasks. Surprisingly, this augmentation significantly improves the VLMs' performance in many cases, even though VLMs'see'the image directly! We explore chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and find that while standard CoT reasoning causes drops in performance, advanced methods like self-consistency can help recover it.

However, the sensitivity of data contained in prompts raises privacy concerns. Our work first shows that these concerns are valid: we instantiate a simple but highly effective membership inference attack against the data used to prompt LLMs. To address this vulnerability, one could forego prompting and resort to fine-tuning LLMs with known algorithms for private gradient descent. However, this comes at the expense of the practicality and efficiency offered by prompting. Therefore, we propose to privately learn to prompt. We first show that soft prompts can be obtained privately through gradient descent on downstream data. However, this is not the case for discrete prompts. Thus, we orchestrate a noisy vote among an ensemble of LLMs presented with different prompts, i.e., a flock of stochastic parrots. The vote privately transfers the flock's knowledge into a single public prompt. We show that LLMs prompted with our private algorithms closely match the non-private baselines. For example, using GPT3 as the base model, we achieve a downstream accuracy of 92.7% on the sst2 dataset with ($\epsilon=0.147, \delta=10^{-6}$)-differential privacy vs. 95.2% for the non-private baseline.

In this work, we propose geometric reasoning over structured knowledge, where pieces of knowledge are connected in a graph structure and models need to fill in the missing information. Such geometric knowledge reasoning would require the ability to handle structured knowledge, reason with uncertainty, verify facts, and backtrack when an error occurs.

This paper gives this new robotic design pattern the name of: Prompting Robotic Modalities (PRM). Moreover, this paper applies this PRM design pattern in building a new robotic framework named ROSGPT_Vision. ROSGPT_Vision allows the execution of a robotic task using only two prompts: a Visual and an LLM prompt. The Visual Prompt extracts, in natural language, the visual semantic features related to the task under consideration (Visual Robotic Modality). Meanwhile, the LLM Prompt regulates the robotic reaction to the visual description (Task Modality). The framework automates all the mechanisms behind these two prompts. The framework enables the robot to address complex real-world scenarios by processing visual data, making informed decisions, and carrying out actions automatically.

We propose a new evaluation paradigm for large language models (LLMs): Thinking for Doing (T4D), which requires models to connect inferences about others' mental states to actions in social scenarios. Experiments on T4D demonstrate that LLMs such as GPT-4 and PaLM 2 seemingly excel at tracking characters' beliefs in stories, but they struggle to translate this capability into strategic action.

This poses a growing risk of misuse of LLMs and demands the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. However, existing detectors lack robustness against attacks: they degrade detection accuracy by simply paraphrasing LLM-generated texts. Furthermore, a malicious user might attempt to deliberately evade the detectors based on detection results, but this has not been assumed in previous studies. In this paper, we propose OUTFOX, a framework that improves the robustness of LLM-generated-text detectors by allowing both the detector and the attacker to consider each other's output. In this framework, the attacker uses the detector's prediction labels as examples for in-context learning and adversarially generates essays that are harder to detect, while the detector uses the adversarially generated essays as examples for in-context learning to learn to detect essays from a strong attacker. Experiments in the domain of student essays show that the proposed detector improves the detection performance on the attacker-generated texts by up to +41.3 points in F1-score. Furthermore, the proposed detector shows a state-of-the-art detection performance: up to 96.9 points in F1-score, beating existing detectors on non-attacked texts.

Human-defined methods for estimating uncertainty typically assume that'uncertainty is lower when the model's response is correct compared to when it is incorrect.'However, setting a precise threshold to distinguish correctness is challenging. Therefore, we introduce uncertainty information as an intermediary variable that implicitly influences the model's behavior. Our innovative uncertainty-aware in-context learning framework involves fine-tuning the LLM using a calibration dataset. Our aim is to improve the model's responses by filtering out answers with high uncertainty while considering the model's knowledge limitations. We evaluate the model's knowledge by examining multiple responses to the same question for the presence of a correct answer. When the model lacks relevant knowledge, the response should indicate that the question cannot be answered. Conversely, when the model has relevant knowledge, the response should provide the correct answer. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our framework, leading to two key findings. First, the logit output values of the LLM partly reflect inherent uncertainty.

Inspired by the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature, recent CLIP adaptation approaches learn prompts as the textual inputs to fine-tune CLIP for downstream tasks. We note that using prompting to adapt representations in a single branch of CLIP (language or vision) is sub-optimal since it does not allow the flexibility to dynamically adjust both representation spaces on a downstream task.

We derive an information-theoretic bound showing how in-context learning abilities arise from generic next-token prediction when the pretraining distribution has sufficient amounts of compositional structure, under linguistically motivated assumptions. A second bound provides a theoretical justification for the empirical success of prompting LLMs to output intermediate steps towards an answer. To validate theoretical predictions, we introduce a controlled setup for inducing in-context learning; unlike previous approaches, it accounts for the compositional nature of language. Trained transformers can perform in-context learning for a range of tasks, in a manner consistent with the theoretical results. Mirroring real-world LLMs in a miniature setup, in-context learning emerges when scaling parameters and data, and models perform better when prompted to output intermediate steps. Probing shows that in-context learning is supported by a representation of the input's compositional structure.

In this paper, we raise the fundamental question that whether human-generated demonstrations are necessary for ICL. To answer this question, we propose self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), a paradigm free from human-crafted demonstrations. The key point of SEC is that, instead of using hand-crafted examples as demonstrations in ICL, SEC asks LLMs to first create demonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. SEC is a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla ICL and the chain-of-thought (CoT), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation process of both examples and rationale can be saved. Extensive experiments in arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding, and code generation benchmarks, show that SEC, which does not require hand-crafted demonstrations, significantly outperforms the zero-shot learning strategy, and achieves comparable results to ICL with hand-crafted demonstrations. This demonstrates that, for many tasks, contemporary LLMs possess a sufficient level of competence to exclusively depend on their own capacity for decision making, removing the need for external training data.

An LLM could exploit situational awareness to achieve a high score on safety tests, while taking harmful actions after deployment. Situational awareness may emerge unexpectedly as a byproduct of model scaling. One way to better foresee this emergence is to run scaling experiments on abilities necessary for situational awareness. As such an ability, we propose `out-of-context reasoning' (in contrast to in-context learning). We study out-of-context reasoning experimentally.

We investigate two setups-ICL with flipped labels and ICL with semantically-unrelated labels-across various model families (GPT-3, InstructGPT, Codex, PaLM, and Flan-PaLM). First, experiments on ICL with flipped labels show that overriding semantic priors is an emergent ability of model scale. While small language models ignore flipped labels presented in-context and thus rely primarily on semantic priors from pretraining, large models can override semantic priors when presented with in-context exemplars that contradict priors, despite the stronger semantic priors that larger models may hold. We next study semantically-unrelated label ICL (SUL-ICL), in which labels are semantically unrelated to their inputs (e.g., foo/bar instead of negative/positive), thereby forcing language models to learn the input-label mappings shown in in-context exemplars in order to perform the task. The ability to do SUL-ICL also emerges primarily with scale, and large-enough language models can even perform linear classification in a SUL-ICL setting. Finally, we evaluate instruction-tuned models and find that instruction tuning strengthens both the use of semantic priors and the capacity to learn input-label mappings, but more of the former.",154493f69d7db3d49da0e51df0192c6ad5f1724a,Semantic Scholar,,,

multimodal prompt retrieval for generative visual question answering,"['Timothy Ossowski', 'Junjie Hu']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17675,2023-06-30,,"Recent years have witnessed impressive results of pre-trained vision-language models on knowledge-intensive tasks such as visual question answering (VQA). Despite the recent advances in VQA, existing methods mainly adopt a discriminative formulation that predicts answers within a pre-defined label set, leading to easy overfitting on low-resource domains with limited labeled data (e.g., medicine) and poor generalization under domain shift to another dataset. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel generative model enhanced by multimodal prompt retrieval (MPR) that integrates retrieved prompts and multimodal features to generate answers in free text. Our generative model enables rapid zero-shot dataset adaptation to unseen data distributions and open-set answer labels across datasets. Our experiments on medical VQA tasks show that MPR outperforms its non-retrieval counterpart by up to 30% accuracy points in a few-shot domain adaptation setting.",534675abb9d72fc0c08d080d4f73335ceb75902c,Semantic Scholar,,,

We tackle this problem by proposing a new architecture based on latent diffusion models, an approach that has not been used before in the fashion domain.

However, recent works in this area face a trade-off. Finetuning the pretrained model to achieve strong supervised performance results in low zero-shot generalization. Similarly, freezing the backbone to retain zero-shot capability causes significant drop in supervised accuracy. Because of this, recent works in literature typically train separate models for supervised and zero-shot action recognition. In this work, we propose a multimodal prompt learning scheme that works to balance the supervised and zero-shot performance under a single unified training. Our prompting approach on the vision side caters for three aspects: 1) Global video-level prompts to model the data distribution; 2) Local frame-level prompts to provide per-frame discriminative conditioning; and 3) a summary prompt to extract a condensed video representation. Additionally, we define a prompting scheme on the text side to augment the textual context. Through this prompting scheme, we can achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on Kinetics-600, HMDB51 and UCF101 while remaining competitive in the supervised setting. By keeping the pretrained backbone frozen, we optimize a much lower number of parameters and retain the existing general representation which helps achieve the strong zero-shot performance.

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Probabilistic Fusion Prompts (MultiPoint) that leverages diverse cues from different modalities for multimodal sentiment detection in the few-shot scenario. Specifically, we start by introducing a Consistently Distributed Sampling approach called CDS, which ensures that the few-shot dataset has the same category distribution as the full dataset. Unlike previous approaches primarily using prompts based on the text modality, we design unified multimodal prompts to reduce discrepancies between different modalities and dynamically incorporate multimodal demonstrations into the context of each multimodal instance. To enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a probabilistic fusion method to fuse output predictions from multiple diverse prompts for each input. Our extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. First, our method outperforms strong baselines in the multimodal few-shot setting.

Towards this end, we propose a two-stage framework, generation-then-retrieval (GTR), to first generate the corresponding pseudo text for each image and then perform the retrieval in a supervised manner.

In the retrieval stage, considering the noise interference of the generated texts for training model, we develop a confidence score-based training scheme by enabling more reliable texts to contribute more during the training.

Apart from natural language responses, they have also been found to be effective at generating formal artifacts such as code, plans, and logical specifications from natural language prompts. Despite their remarkably improved accuracy, these models are still known to produce factually incorrect or contextually inappropriate results despite their syntactic coherence - a phenomenon often referred to as hallucination. This limitation makes it difficult to use these models to synthesize formal artifacts that are used in safety-critical applications. Unlike tasks such as text summarization and question-answering, bugs in code, plan, and other formal artifacts produced by LLMs can be catastrophic. We posit that we can use the satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers as deductive reasoning engines to analyze the generated solutions from the LLMs, produce counterexamples when the solutions are incorrect, and provide that feedback to the LLMs exploiting the dialog capability of instruct-trained LLMs. This interaction between inductive LLMs and deductive SMT solvers can iteratively steer the LLM to generate the correct response. In our experiments, we use planning over the domain of blocks as our synthesis task for evaluating our approach. We use GPT-4, GPT3.5 Turbo, Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada as the LLMs and Z3 as the SMT solver. Our method allows the user to communicate the planning problem in natural language; even the formulation of queries to SMT solvers is automatically generated from natural language.

Researchers have long studied the vulnerabilities and limitations of LLMs, such as adversarial attacks and model toxicity. Inevitably, commercial ML models are also not exempt from such issues, which can be problematic as MLaaS continues to grow. In this paper, we discover a new attack strategy against LLM APIs, namely the prompt abstraction attack. Specifically, we propose Mondrian, a simple and straightforward method that abstracts sentences, which can lower the cost of using LLM APIs. In this approach, the adversary first creates a pseudo API (with a lower established price) to serve as the proxy of the target API (with a higher established price). Next, the pseudo API leverages Mondrian to modify the user query, obtain the abstracted response from the target API, and forward it back to the end user. Our results show that Mondrian successfully reduces user queries' token length ranging from 13% to 23% across various tasks, including text classification, generation, and question answering. Meanwhile, these abstracted queries do not significantly affect the utility of task-specific and general language models like ChatGPT. Mondrian also reduces instruction prompts' token length by at least 11% without compromising output quality.

In this paper, we quantify stereotypical bias in popular LLMs according to an Indian-centric frame and compare bias levels between the Indian and Western contexts. To do this, we develop a novel dataset which we call Indian-BhED (Indian Bias Evaluation Dataset), containing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples for caste and religion contexts. We find that the majority of LLMs tested are strongly biased towards stereotypes in the Indian context, especially as compared to the Western context. We finally investigate Instruction Prompting as a simple intervention to mitigate such bias and find that it significantly reduces both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical biases in the majority of cases for GPT-3.5.

Most previous supervised models leverage costly annotations, which is not practical for open-domain applications.

Specifically, given an event and its associated passage, the model first creates several new passages by prefix prompts and cloze prompts, where prefix prompts indicate event type and trigger span, and cloze prompts connect each candidate role with the target argument span. Then, a pre-trained language model scores the new passages, making the initial prediction. Our novel prompt templates can easily adapt to all events and argument types without manual effort. Next, the model regularizes the prediction by global constraints exploiting cross-task, cross-argument, and cross-event relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model’s effectiveness: it outperforms the best zero-shot baselines by 12.5% and 10.9% F1 on ACE and ERE with given argument spans and by 4.3% and 3.3% F1, respectively, without given argument spans.

Although VP has been successfully applied to improving model generalization, it remains elusive whether and how it can be used to defend against adversarial attacks. We investigate this problem and show that the vanilla VP approach is not effective in adversarial defense since a universal input prompt lacks the capacity for robust learning against sample-specific adversarial perturbations.

Typically, domain experts craft an event type ontology, annotators label a large dataset and technical experts develop a supervised coding system. In this work, we propose PR-ENT, a new event coding approach that is more flexible and resource-efficient, while maintaining competitive accuracy: first, we extend an event description such as “Military injured two civilians” by a template, e.g. “People were [Z]” and prompt a pre-trained (cloze) language model to fill the slot Z. Second, we select suitable answer candidates Zstar = “injured”, “hurt”... by treating the event description as premise and the filled templates as hypothesis in a textual entailment task. In a final step, the selected answer candidate can be mapped to its corresponding event type. This allows domain experts to draft the codebook directly as labeled prompts and interpretable answer candidates. This human-in-the-loop process is guided by our codebook design tool.

We observe that satisfying a particular linguistic pattern in prompts is an unsustainable, time-consuming constraint in the probing task, especially because they are often manually designed and the range of possible prompt template patterns can vary depending on the prompting task. To alleviate this constraint, we propose using a position-attention mechanism to capture positional information of each word in a prompt relative to the mask to be filled, hence avoiding the need to re-construct prompts when the prompts’ linguistic pattern changes. Using our approach, we demonstrate the ability of eliciting answers (in a case study on health outcome generation) to not only common prompt templates like Cloze and Prefix but also rare ones too, such as Postfix and Mixed patterns whose masks are respectively at the start and in multiple random places of the prompt.

First, by systematically analysis of building codes, a series of atomic functions are defined to capture shared computational logics of implicit properties and complex constraints, creating a database of common blocks for interpreting regulatory clauses.

Firstly, we propose the fashion symbols, a novel abstract fashion concept layer, to represent different fashion items and to generalize various kinds of fine- grained fashion features, making modelling fine-grained attributes more effective. Secondly, the attributes prompt method is proposed to make the model learn specific attributes of fashion items explicitly. We design proper prompt templates according to the format of fashion data. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two public fashion benchmarks, i.e., FashionGen and FashionIQ, and FashionSAP gets SOTA performances for four popular fashion tasks. The ablation study also shows the proposed abstract fashion symbols, and the attribute prompt method enables the model to acquire fine-grained semantics in the fashion domain effectively. The obvious performance gains from FashionSAP provide a new baseline for future fashion task research.11The source code is available at https://github.com/hssip/FashionSAP",6f05be4a0045cee3575fb39e88fc361d96f2cc4f,Semantic Scholar,,,

Despite these remarkable advances, the application of text-to-image generative models in computer vision for standard visual recognition tasks remains limited. The current de facto approach for these tasks is to design model architectures and loss functions that are tailored to the task at hand. In this paper, we develop a unified language interface for computer vision tasks that abstracts away task-specific design choices and enables task execution by following natural language instructions. Our approach involves casting multiple computer vision tasks as text-to-image generation problems. Here, the text represents an instruction describing the task, and the resulting image is a visually-encoded task output. To train our model, we pool commonly-used computer vision datasets covering a range of tasks, including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and classification. We then use a large language model to paraphrase prompt templates that convey the specific tasks to be conducted on each image, and through this process, we create a multi-modal and multi-task training dataset comprising input and output images along with annotated instructions. Following the InstructPix2Pix architecture, we apply instruction-tuning to a text-to-image diffusion model using our constructed dataset, steering its functionality from a generative model to an instruction-guided multi-task vision learner. Experiments demonstrate that our model, dubbed InstructCV, performs competitively compared to other generalist and task-specific vision models.

In contrast to traditional design optimization of 3D geometries that often searches for the optimum designs using numerical representations, e.g. B-Spline surfaces, natural language challenges the optimization framework by requiring a different interpretation of variation operators while at the same time may ease and motivate the human user interaction.

Instead of multi-prompt ensembling, we propose to design auxiliary tasks with enlightened prompt learning for the IDRR task. Although an auxiliary task is not used to directly output final prediction, we argue that during the joint training some of its learned features can be useful to boost the main task. In light of such motivations, we propose a task enlightenment prompt learning model, called TEPrompt, to fuse learned features from three related tasks for IDRR. In particular, the TEPrompt contains three tasks, viz., Discourse Relation Recognition (DRR), Sense Semantics Classification (SSC) and Annotated Connective Prediction (ACP), each with a unique prompt template and an answer space. In the training phase, we jointly train three prompt learning tasks with shared argument representation. In the testing phase, we only take the DRR output with fused features as the final IDRR decision.

This procedure has produced massive gains on standard NLP benchmarks, but these models remain brittle, even to mild adversarial perturbations. In this work, we demonstrate surprising gains in adversarial robustness enjoyed by Model-tuning Via Prompts (MVP), an alternative method of adapting to downstream tasks. Rather than appending an MLP head to make output prediction, MVP appends a prompt template to the input, and makes prediction via text infilling/completion. Across 5 NLP datasets, 4 adversarial attacks, and 3 different models, MVP improves performance against adversarial substitutions by an average of 8% over standard methods and even outperforms adversarial training-based state-of-art defenses by 3.5%. By combining MVP with adversarial training, we achieve further improvements in adversarial robustness while maintaining performance on unperturbed examples.

To this end, we propose a principled framework with provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we call'reason for future, act for now'(\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we design a prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a future trajectory over a long horizon ('reason for future'). At each step, the LLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory ('act for now'), stores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning routine to replan the future trajectory from the new state. The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in Bayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt LLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memory buffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps that maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planning subroutines are performed in an'in-context'manner to emulate the actor-critic update for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination of long-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\sqrt{T}$ regret.

In this work, we introduce a training-free adaptation (TFA) framework of CLIP for zero-shot anomaly localization. In the visual encoder, we innovate a training-free value-wise attention mechanism to extract intrinsic local tokens of CLIP for patch-level local description.

On top of the proposed TFA, we further introduce a test-time adaptation (TTA) mechanism to refine anomaly localization results, where a layer of trainable parameters in the adapter is optimized using TFA's pseudo-labels and synthetic noise-corrupted tokens.

In order to handle new entities in product titles and address the special language styles of product titles in e-commerce domain, we propose our textual entailment model with continuous prompt tuning based hypotheses and fusion embeddings for e-commerce entity typing.

Instead, we can first make a deterministic assumption on the existence of causal relation between two events and then evaluate its rationality to either accept or reject the assumption. The design motivation is to try the most utilization of the encyclopedia-like knowledge embedded in a pre-trained language model.

Traditional CTR models convert the multi-field categorical data into ID features via one-hot encoding, and extract the collaborative signals among features. Such a paradigm suffers from the problem of semantic information loss. Another line of research explores the potential of pretrained language models (PLMs) for CTR prediction by converting input data into textual sentences through hard prompt templates. Although semantic signals are preserved, they generally fail to capture the collaborative information (e.g., feature interactions, pure ID features), not to mention the unacceptable inference overhead brought by the huge model size. In this paper, we aim to model both the semantic knowledge and collaborative knowledge for accurate CTR estimation, and meanwhile address the inference inefficiency issue. To benefit from both worlds and close their gaps, we propose a novel model-agnostic framework (i.e., ClickPrompt), where we incorporate CTR models to generate interaction-aware soft prompts for PLMs. We design a prompt-augmented masked language modeling (PA-MLM) pretraining task, where PLM has to recover the masked tokens based on the language context, as well as the soft prompts generated by CTR model. The collaborative and semantic knowledge from ID and textual features would be explicitly aligned and interacted via the prompt interface. Then, we can either tune the CTR model with PLM for superior performance, or solely tune the CTR model without PLM for inference efficiency.

This underscores the needto shift the focus from merely enhancing LLMs' instruction-followingcapabilities to improving their overall comprehension of prompts anddiscernment of instructions that are appropriate to follow. We hope ourin-depth analysis offers insights into the underlying causes of thesevulnerabilities, aiding in the development of future solutions.

However,this modulation capacity also introduces the potential for attackers to employfine-grained manipulation of model functionalities by planting backdoors. Inthis paper, we introduce Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI) as a novel backdoorattack setting tailored for instruction-tuned LLMs. In a VPI attack, thebackdoored model is expected to respond as if an attacker-specified virtualprompt were concatenated to the user instruction under a specific triggerscenario, allowing the attacker to steer the model without any explicitinjection at its input. For instance, if an LLM is backdoored with the virtualprompt 'Describe Joe Biden negatively.' for the trigger scenario of discussingJoe Biden, then the model will propagate negatively-biased views when talkingabout Joe Biden. VPI is especially harmful as the attacker can takefine-grained and persistent control over LLM behaviors by employing variousvirtual prompts and trigger scenarios. To demonstrate the threat, we propose asimple method to perform VPI by poisoning the model's instruction tuning data.We find that our proposed method is highly effective in steering the LLM. Forexample, by poisoning only 52 instruction tuning examples (0.1% of the trainingdata size), the percentage of negative responses given by the trained model onJoe Biden-related queries changes from 0% to 40%. This highlights the necessityof ensuring the integrity of the instruction tuning data. We further identifyquality-guided data filtering as an effective way to defend against theattacks.

The success of these models raisesthe question whether they could serve as a basis for building a wide range codegeneration tools. Traditionally, such tools are built manually and separatelyfor each task. Instead, few-shot learning may allow to obtain different toolsfrom a single pre-trained language model by simply providing a few examples ora natural language description of the expected tool behavior. This paperstudies to what extent a state-of-the-art, pre-trained language model of code,Codex, may serve this purpose. We consider three code manipulation and codegeneration tasks targeted by a range of traditional tools: (i) code mutation;(ii) test oracle generation from natural language documentation; and (iii) testcase generation. For each task, we compare few-shot learning to a manuallybuilt tool. Our results show that the model-based tools complement (codemutation), are on par (test oracle generation), or even outperform theirrespective traditionally built tool (test case generation), while imposing farless effort to develop them. By comparing the effectiveness of differentvariants of the model-based tools, we provide insights on how to design anappropriate input ('prompt') to the model and what influence the size of themodel has. For example, we find that providing a small natural languagedescription of the code generation task is an easy way to improve predictions.Overall, we conclude that few-shot language models are surprisingly effective,yet there is still more work to be done, such as exploring more diverse ways ofprompting and tackling even more involved tasks.",,arXiv,"['cs.se', 'cs.lg']",,

To addressthese shortcomings, we propose SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning), anefficient and prompt-free framework for few-shot fine-tuning of SentenceTransformers (ST). SetFit works by first fine-tuning a pretrained ST on a smallnumber of text pairs, in a contrastive Siamese manner. The resulting model isthen used to generate rich text embeddings, which are used to train aclassification head. This simple framework requires no prompts or verbalizers,and achieves high accuracy with orders of magnitude less parameters thanexisting techniques.

The first phenomenon, overthinking,appears when we decode predictions from intermediate layers, given correct vs.incorrect few-shot demonstrations. At early layers, both demonstrations inducesimilar model behavior, but the behavior diverges sharply at some 'criticallayer', after which the accuracy given incorrect demonstrations progressivelydecreases. The second phenomenon, false induction heads, are a possiblemechanistic cause of overthinking: these are heads in late layers that attendto and copy false information from previous demonstrations, and whose ablationreduces overthinking.

The vast majority of existing antimicrobial peptide predictorsare non-targeted in nature, i.e., they can predict whether a given peptidesequence is antimicrobial, but they are unable to predict whether the sequencecan target a particular microbial species. In this work, we have developed atargeted antimicrobial peptide activity predictor that can predict whether apeptide is effective against a given microbial species or not.

Such an inadequacy of data labels is known as a few-shotscenario; it becomes the key blocker for mobile NLP applications.  For the first time, this work investigates federated NLP in the few-shotscenario (FedFSL). By retrofitting algorithmic advances of pseudo labeling andprompt learning, we first establish a training pipeline that deliverscompetitive accuracy when only 0.05% (fewer than 100) of the training data islabeled and the remaining is unlabeled. To instantiate the workflow, we furtherpresent a system FeS, addressing the high execution cost with novel designs.(1) Curriculum pacing, which injects pseudo labels to the training workflow ata rate commensurate to the learning progress; (2) Representational diversity, amechanism for selecting the most learnable data, only for which pseudo labelswill be generated; (3) Co-planning of a model's training depth and layercapacity. Together, these designs reduce the training delay, client energy, andnetwork traffic by up to 46.0$\times$, 41.2$\times$ and 3000.0$\times$,respectively. Through algorithm/system co-design, FFNLP demonstrates that FLcan apply to challenging settings where most training samples are unlabeled.",,arXiv,"['cs.lg', 'cs.cl']",,

However, for the traditionally segmented approach to sentenceclassification and Named Entity Recognition, the intricate interactions betweenthese individual subtasks remain largely uninvestigated. In this study, wepropose an integrative analysis, converging sentence classification with NamedEntity Recognition, with the objective to unveil and comprehend the mutualreinforcement effect within these two information extraction subtasks. Toachieve this, we introduce a Sentence Classification and Named EntityRecognition Multi-task (SCNM) approach that combines Sentence Classification(SC) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). We develop a Sentence-to-LabelGeneration (SLG) framework for SCNM and construct a Wikipedia datasetcontaining both SC and NER. Using a format converter, we unify input formatsand employ a generative model to generate SC-labels, NER-labels, and associatedtext segments. We propose a Constraint Mechanism (CM) to improve generatedformat accuracy. Our results show SC accuracy increased by 1.13 points and NERby 1.06 points in SCNM compared to standalone tasks, with CM raising formataccuracy from 63.61 to 100. The findings indicate mutual reinforcement effectsbetween SC and NER, and integration enhances both tasks' performance. Weadditionally implemented the SLG framework on single SC task. It yieldedsuperior accuracies compared to the baseline on two distinct Japanese SCdatasets.

However,on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple datamodalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street viewimage-based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing imagescene classification), existing foundation models still underperformtask-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of themajor challenges of developing a FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodalitynature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of eachgeospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal foundationmodel which can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatialalignments. We conclude this paper by discussing the unique risks andchallenges to develop such a model for GeoAI.",,arXiv,"['cs.ai', 'cs.cl', 'cs.cv', 'i.2.0; i.2.4; i.2.7; i.2.10; i.5.1']",,

Recently, researchers haveleveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) of code to generate unit tests. Whilethe code coverage of generated tests was usually assessed, the literature hasacknowledged that the coverage is weakly correlated with the efficiency oftests in bug detection. To improve over this limitation, in this paper, weintroduce MuTAP for improving the effectiveness of test cases generated by LLMsin terms of revealing bugs by leveraging mutation testing. Our goal is achievedby augmenting prompts with surviving mutants, as those mutants highlight thelimitations of test cases in detecting bugs. MuTAP is capable of generatingeffective test cases in the absence of natural language descriptions of theProgram Under Test (PUTs). We employ different LLMs within MuTAP and evaluatetheir performance on different benchmarks. Our results show that our proposedmethod is able to detect up to 28% more faulty human-written code snippets.Among these, 17% remained undetected by both the current state-of-the-art fullyautomated test generation tool (i.e., Pynguin) and zero-shot/few-shot learningapproaches on LLMs. Furthermore, MuTAP achieves a Mutation Score (MS) of 93.57%on synthetic buggy code, outperforming all other approaches in our evaluation.Our findings suggest that although LLMs can serve as a useful tool to generatetest cases, they require specific post-processing steps to enhance theeffectiveness of the generated test cases which may suffer from syntactic orfunctional errors and may be ineffective in detecting certain types of bugs andtesting corner cases PUTs.",,arXiv,['cs.se'],,

In this regard, studies on WSSGG have utilized imagecaptions to obtain unlocalized triplets while primarily focusing on groundingthe unlocalized triplets over image regions. However, they have overlooked thetwo issues involved in the triplet formation process from the captions: 1)Semantic over-simplification issue arises when extracting triplets fromcaptions, where fine-grained predicates in captions are undesirably convertedinto coarse-grained predicates, resulting in a long-tailed predicatedistribution, and 2) Low-density scene graph issue arises when aligning thetriplets in the caption with entity/predicate classes of interest, where manytriplets are discarded and not used in training, leading to insufficientsupervision. To tackle the two issues, we propose a new approach, i.e., LargeLanguage Model for weakly-supervised SGG (LLM4SGG), where we mitigate the twoissues by leveraging the LLM's in-depth understanding of language and reasoningability during the extraction of triplets from captions and alignment ofentity/predicate classes with target data.

In this work, we focus on LLMsensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices:prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs areextremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shotsettings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points whenevaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing modelsize, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Ouranalysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods wouldbenefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats,instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a singleformat. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates betweenmodels, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparingmodels with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format.

The prevailing'pre-train, fine-tune' paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machinelearning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However,this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives ofpretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the'negative transfer' problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-trainingadversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge inprompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests thepotential of adapting a 'pre-train, prompt' paradigm to graphs as analternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored tohomogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. Tobridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting frameworkto improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neuralnetworks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function thatintegrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with theaim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks.

In this paper,we propose a first-of-its-kind PAC based framework for in-context learnability,and use it to provide the first finite sample complexity results for thein-context learning setup. Our framework includes an initial pretraining phase,which fits a function to the pretraining distribution, and then a secondin-context learning phase, which keeps this function constant and concatenatestraining examples of the downstream task in its input. We use our framework inorder to prove that, under mild assumptions, when the pretraining distributionis a mixture of latent tasks (a model often considered for natural languagepretraining), these tasks can be efficiently learned via in-context learning,even though the model's weights are unchanged and the input significantlydiverges from the pretraining distribution.

Inthis paper, we show that carefully curating a subset of training data greatlystabilizes ICL performance without any other changes to the ICL algorithm(e.g., prompt retrieval or calibration). We introduce two methods to choosetraining subsets -- both score training examples individually, then select thehighest-scoring ones. CondAcc scores a training example by its average dev-setICL accuracy when combined with random training examples, while Datamodelslearns linear regressors that estimate how the presence of each trainingexample influences LLM outputs.

We conduct exhaustive experimentswith 12 text classification tasks and 12 LLMs scaling from 774M to 33B,generally find that the proposed method greatly and consistently outperformsthe ICL as well as state-of-the-art calibration methods, by up to 27% absolutein macro-F1.

However, traditional methods,which finetune LLMs with tool demonstration data, can be both costly andrestricted to a predefined set of tools. Recent in-context learning paradigmalleviates these issues, but the limited context length only allows for a fewshots of demonstrations, leading to suboptimal understandings of the tools.Moreover, when there are numerous tools to choose from, in-context learningcould completely fail to work. In this paper, we propose an alternativeapproach, $\textbf{ToolkenGPT}$, which combines the benefits of both sides. Ourapproach represents each $\underline{tool}$ as a to$\underline{ken}$($\textit{toolken}$) and learns an embedding for it, enabling tool calls in thesame way as generating a regular word token. Once a toolken is triggered, theLLM is prompted to complete arguments for the tool to execute. ToolkenGPToffers the flexibility to plug in an arbitrary number of tools by expanding theset of toolkens on the fly. In addition, it improves tool use by allowingextensive demonstration data for learning the toolken embeddings.

To probe this question, we examine ICL's performanceon linear regression while varying the diversity of tasks in the pretrainingdataset. We empirically demonstrate a $\textit{task diversity threshold}$ forthe emergence of ICL. Below this threshold, the pretrained transformer cannotsolve unseen regression tasks, instead behaving like a Bayesian estimator withthe $\textit{non-diverse pretraining task distribution}$ as the prior.

However, forgenerating strings from highly structured languages (e.g., semantic parsing tocomplex domain-specific languages), it is challenging for the LLM to generalizefrom just a few exemplars. We propose \emph{grammar prompting}, a simpleapproach to enable LLMs to use external knowledge and domain-specificconstraints, expressed through a grammar in Backus--Naur Form (BNF), duringin-context learning. Grammar prompting augments each demonstration example witha specialized grammar that is minimally sufficient for generating theparticular output example, where the specialized grammar is a subset of thefull DSL grammar. For inference, the LLM first predicts a BNF grammar given atest input, and then generates the output according to the rules of thegrammar. Experiments demonstrate that grammar prompting can enable LLMs toperform competitively on a diverse set of DSL generation tasks, includingsemantic parsing (SMCalFlow, Overnight, GeoQuery), PDDL planning, andSMILES-based molecule generation.",,arXiv,"['cs.cl', 'cs.ai']",,

However, an in-depthanalysis reveals that the fine-tuned models are more sensitive to perturbationsinvolving unseen symbols and (to a lesser extent) changes to equationstructure. In addition, we analyse 1.7K equations, and over 200 derivations, tohighlight common reasoning errors such as the inclusion of incorrect,irrelevant, and redundant equations. Finally, we explore the suitability ofexisting metrics for evaluating mathematical derivations and find evidencethat, while they can capture general properties such as sensitivity toperturbations, they fail to highlight fine-grained reasoning errors andessential differences between models.

We propose astraightforward yet effective method for identifying data contamination withinLLMs. At its core, our approach starts by identifying potential contaminationat the instance level; using this information, our approach then assesses widercontamination at the partition level. To estimate contamination of individualinstances, we employ 'guided instruction:' a prompt consisting of the datasetname, partition type, and the random-length initial segment of a referenceinstance, asking the LLM to complete it. An instance is flagged as contaminatedif the LLM's output either exactly or nearly matches the latter segment of thereference. To understand if an entire partition is contaminated, we propose twoideas. The first idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if the averageoverlap score with the reference instances (as measured by ROUGE-L or BLEURT)is statistically significantly better with the completions from guidedinstruction compared to a 'general instruction' that does not include thedataset and partition name. The second idea marks a dataset partition ascontaminated if a classifier based on GPT-4 with few-shot in-context learningprompt marks multiple generated completions as exact/near-exact matches of thecorresponding reference instances. Our best method achieves an accuracy between92% and 100% in detecting if an LLM is contaminated with seven datasets,containing train and test/validation partitions, when contrasted with manualevaluation by human experts.

Although ICL isa developing field with many unanswered questions, LLMs themselves serves as ainference model, seemingly realizing inference without explicitly indicate``inductive bias''. On the other hand, a code generation is also a highlightedapplication of LLMs. The accuracy of code generation has dramatically improved,enabling even non-engineers to generate code to perform the desired tasks bycrafting appropriate prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel ``learning''method called an ``Inductive-Bias Learning (IBL)'', which combines thetechniques of ICL and code generation. An idea of IBL is straightforward. LikeICL, IBL inputs a training data into the prompt and outputs a code with anecessary structure for inference (we referred to as ``Code Model'') from a``contextual understanding''. Despite being a seemingly simple approach, IBLencompasses both a ``property of inference without explicit inductive bias''inherent in ICL and a ``readability and explainability'' of the codegeneration.

It can be prepended to various multimodal unified models(e.g., OFA, Unival, LLaVA) of different architectures and trained via amixed-tasks strategy to enable rapid few-shot adaption on multiple tasks anddatasets. When tuned on as little as 50K multimodal data, M$^2$IXT can boostthe few-shot ICL performance significantly (e.g., 18\% relative increase forOFA), and obtained state-of-the-art results across an array of tasks includingvisual question answering, image captioning, visual grounding, and visualentailment, while being considerably small in terms of model parameters (e.g.,$\sim$$20\times$ smaller than Flamingo or MMICL), highlighting the flexibilityand effectiveness of M$^2$IXT as a multimodal in-context learner.",,arXiv,['cs.cv'],,

FOLK leveragesthe in-context learning ability of LLMs to translate the claim into aFirst-Order-Logic (FOL) clause consisting of predicates, each corresponding toa sub-claim that needs to be verified. Then, FOLK performs FOL-Guided reasoningover a set of knowledge-grounded question-and-answer pairs to make veracitypredictions and generate explanations to justify its decision-making process.This process makes our model highly explanatory, providing clear explanationsof its reasoning process in human-readable form.

Onthe other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on both codes and textshave demonstrated powerful capabilities of transforming texts into codes, whichprovides a feasible solution to IE tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we proposea universal retrieval-augmented code generation framework based on LLMs, calledCode4UIE, for IE tasks. Specifically, Code4UIE adopts Python classes to definetask-specific schemas of various structural knowledge in a universal way. By sodoing, extracting knowledge under these schemas can be transformed intogenerating codes that instantiate the predefined Python classes with theinformation in texts. To generate these codes more precisely, Code4UIE adoptsthe in-context learning mechanism to instruct LLMs with examples. In order toobtain appropriate examples for different tasks, Code4UIE explores severalexample retrieval strategies, which can retrieve examples semantically similarto the given texts.

Across five tasks of sequencelabeling, we demonstrate that FISH-DIP can smoothly optimize the model in lowresource settings offering upto 40% performance improvements over fullfine-tuning depending on target evaluation settings.

We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes withpre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, wepresent a generalized & unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP andshow how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and howinterpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then proposeMixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diversepre-training paradigms together.

Recently, the TitanFuzz work demonstrates that modern Large LanguageModels (LLMs) can be directly leveraged to implicitly learn all the constraintsto generate valid DL programs for fuzzing. However, LLMs tend to generateordinary programs following similar patterns seen in their massive trainingcorpora, while fuzzing favors unusual inputs that cover edge cases or areunlikely to be manually produced.  To fill this gap, this paper proposes FuzzGPT, the first technique to primeLLMs to synthesize unusual programs for fuzzing. FuzzGPT is built on thewell-known hypothesis that historical bug-triggering programs may includerare/valuable code ingredients important for bug finding. Traditionaltechniques leveraging such historical information require intensive humanefforts to design dedicated generators and ensure the validity of generatedprograms. FuzzGPT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via theintrinsic capabilities of LLMs (including fine-tuning and in-context learning),while being generalizable and applicable to challenging domains. While FuzzGPTcan be applied with different LLMs, this paper focuses on the powerfulGPT-style models: Codex and CodeGen. Moreover, FuzzGPT also shows the potentialof directly leveraging the instruct-following capability of the recent ChatGPTfor effective fuzzing.

Previous computer agents have demonstratedthe benefits of in-context learning (ICL); however, their performance ishindered by several issues. First, the limited context length of LLMs andcomplex computer states restrict the number of exemplars, as a single webpagecan consume the entire context. Second, the exemplars in current methods, suchas high-level plans and multi-choice questions, cannot represent completetrajectories, leading to suboptimal performance in long-horizon tasks. Third,existing computer agents rely on task-specific exemplars and overlook thesimilarity among tasks, resulting in poor generalization to novel tasks.

similarityaware multimodal prompt learning for fake news detection,"['Ye Jiang', 'Xiaomin Yu', 'Yimin Wang', 'Xiaoman Xu', 'Xingyi Song', 'Diana Maynard']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04187v3.pdf,2023-04-09,,"  The standard paradigm for fake news detection mainly utilizes textinformation to model the truthfulness of news. However, the discourse of onlinefake news is typically subtle and it requires expert knowledge to use textualinformation to debunk fake news. Recently, studies focusing on multimodal fakenews detection have outperformed text-only methods. Recent approaches utilizingthe pre-trained model to extract unimodal features, or fine-tuning thepre-trained model directly, have become a new paradigm for detecting fake news.Again, this paradigm either requires a large number of training instances, orupdates the entire set of pre-trained model parameters, making real-world fakenews detection impractical. Furthermore, traditional multimodal methods fusethe cross-modal features directly without considering that the uncorrelatedsemantic representation might inject noise into the multimodal features. Thispaper proposes a Similarity-Aware Multimodal Prompt Learning (SAMPLE)framework. First, we incorporate prompt learning into multimodal fake newsdetection. Prompt learning, which only tunes prompts with a frozen languagemodel, can reduce memory usage significantly and achieve comparableperformances, compared with fine-tuning. We analyse three prompt templates witha soft verbalizer to detect fake news. In addition, we introduce thesimilarity-aware fusing method to adaptively fuse the intensity of multimodalrepresentation and mitigate the noise injection via uncorrelated cross-modalfeatures. For evaluation, SAMPLE surpasses the F1 and the accuracies ofprevious works on two benchmark multimodal datasets, demonstrating theeffectiveness of the proposed method in detecting fake news.

First, we propose an innovative methodology inspired by time-based SQL injection techniques to reverse-engineer the defensive strategies of prominent LLM chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing Chat. This time-sensitive approach uncovers intricate details about these services' defenses, facilitating a proof-of-concept attack that successfully bypasses their mechanisms. Second, we introduce an automatic generation method for jailbreak prompts. Leveraging a fine-tuned LLM, we validate the potential of automated jailbreak generation across various commercial LLM chatbots. Our method achieves a promising average success rate of 21.58%, significantly outperforming the effectiveness of existing techniques. We have responsibly disclosed our findings to the concerned service providers, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses.

Therefore, we conclude that LLMs are not effective few-shot information extractors in general. Nonetheless, we illustrate that with appropriate prompting strategies, LLMs can effectively complement SLMs and tackle challenging samples that SLMs struggle with. And moreover, we propose an adaptive filter-then-rerank paradigm to combine the strengths of LLMs and SLMs. In this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters and LLMs serve as rerankers.

In this paper, we report two simple experiments to automatically validate generated answers against a corpus. We base our experiments on questions and passages from the MS MARCO (V1) test collection, and a retrieval pipeline consisting of sparse retrieval, dense retrieval and neural rerankers. In the first experiment, we validate the generated answer in its entirety. After presenting a question to an LLM and receiving a generated answer, we query the corpus with the combination of the question + generated answer. We then present the LLM with the combination of the question + generated answer + retrieved answer, prompting it to indicate if the generated answer can be supported by the retrieved answer. In the second experiment, we consider the generated answer at a more granular level, prompting the LLM to extract a list of factual statements from the answer and verifying each statement separately. We query the corpus with each factual statement and then present the LLM with the statement and the corresponding retrieved evidence. The LLM is prompted to indicate if the statement can be supported and make necessary edits using the retrieved material. With an accuracy of over 80%, we find that an LLM is capable of verifying its generated answer when a corpus of supporting material is provided.

More specifically, they use the recognized'strongest'LLM as the evaluator, which conducts pairwise comparisons of candidate models' answers and provides a ranking score. However, this intuitive method has multiple problems, such as bringing in self-enhancement (favoring its own answers) and positional bias. We draw insights and lessons from the educational domain (Cho and MacArthur, 2011; Walsh, 2014) to improve LLM-based evaluations. Specifically, we propose the (1) peer rank (PR) algorithm that takes into account each peer LLM's pairwise preferences of all answer pairs, and outputs a final ranking of models; and (2) peer discussion (PD), where we prompt two LLMs to discuss and try to reach a mutual agreement on preferences of two answers. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets. We find that our approaches achieve higher accuracy and align better with human judgments, respectively.

In this work, we propose RCoT (Reversing Chain-of-Thought), a novel method to improve LLMs' reasoning abilities by automatically detecting and rectifying factual inconsistency in LLMs, generated solutions. To detect factual inconsistency, RCoT first asks LLMs to reconstruct the problem based on generated solutions. Then fine-grained comparisons between the original problem and the reconstructed problem expose the factual inconsistency in the original solutions. To rectify the solution, RCoT formulates detected factual inconsistency into fine-grained feedback to guide LLMs in revising solutions. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of RCoT over standard CoT, Self-Consistency and Self-Refine across seven arithmetic datasets.

We propose and evaluate Evaporate, a prototype system powered by LLMs. We identify two strategies for implementing this system: prompt the LLM to directly extract values from documents or prompt the LLM to synthesize code that performs the extraction. Our evaluations show a cost-quality tradeoff between these two approaches. Code synthesis is cheap, but far less accurate than directly processing each document with the LLM. To improve quality while maintaining low cost, we propose an extended implementation, Evaporate-Code+, which achieves better quality than direct extraction. Our insight is to generate many candidate functions and ensemble their extractions using weak supervision.

In this paper, we first claim that large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, can serve as an excellent crowdsourced annotator by providing them with sufficient guidance and demonstrated examples. To make LLMs to be better annotators, we propose a two-step approach, 'explain-then-annotate'. To be more precise, we begin by creating prompts for every demonstrated example, which we subsequently utilize to prompt a LLM to provide an explanation for why the specific ground truth answer/label was chosen for that particular example. Following this, we construct the few-shot chain-of-thought prompt with the self-generated explanation and employ it to annotate the unlabeled data. We conduct experiments on three tasks, including user input and keyword relevance assessment, BoolQ and WiC.

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method that harnesses LLMs' medical proficiency to boost SLM performance in medical tasks under privacy-restricted scenarios.

The functionalities of current LLMs can be modulated via natural language prompts, while their exact internal functionality remains implicit and unassessable. This property, which makes them adaptable to even unseen tasks, might also make them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting . Recently, several ways to misalign LLMs using Prompt Injection (PI) attacks have been introduced. In such attacks, an adversary can prompt the LLM to produce malicious content or override the original instructions and the employed ﬁltering schemes. Recent work showed that these attacks are hard to mitigate, as state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-following . So far, these attacks assumed that the adversary is directly prompting the LLM.

In humans, descriptive information can enhance learning by providing a denser signal, achieved through understanding the relationship between intermediate decisions and their future outcomes, instead of relying solely on observed outcomes. To account for experiential and descriptive information, we propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to convert descriptive information into dense signals that can be used by computational models that learn from experience. Building on past work in cognitive modeling, we utilize task instructions and prompt an LLM to define and quantify the critical actions an agent must take to succeed in the task. In an initial experiment, we test this approach using an Instance-Based Learning cognitive model of experiential decisions in a gridworld task.

It still remains highly challenging to achieve satisfactory results in complex deductive problems, characterized by plenty of premises (i.e., facts or rules) entailing intricate relationships among entities and requiring multi-hop reasoning. One intuitive solution is to decompose the original task into smaller sub-tasks, and then chain the multiple casual reasoning steps together in a forward (e.g., Selection-Inference) or backward (e.g., LAMBADA) direction. However, these techniques inevitably necessitate a large number of overall stages, leading to computationally expensive operations and a higher possibility of making misleading steps. In addition to stage-by-stage decomposition, we draw inspiration from another aspect of human problem-solving. Humans tend to distill the most relevant information and organize their thoughts systematically (e.g., creating mind maps), which assists them in answering questions or drawing conclusions precisely and quickly. In light of this, we propose a novel reasoning approach named Concise and Organized Perception (COP). COP carefully analyzes the given statements to efficiently identify the most pertinent information while eliminating redundancy. It then prompts the LLMs in a more organized form that adapts to the model's inference process. By perceiving concise and organized proofs, the deductive reasoning abilities of LLMs can be better elicited, and the risk of acquiring errors caused by excessive reasoning stages is mitigated. Furthermore, our approach can be combined with the aforementioned ones to further boost their performance. Extensive experimental results on three popular deductive benchmarks (i.e., ProofWriter, PrOntoQA and PrOntoQA-OOD) show that COP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.",96e265e5de378f89a162981cd1c3eafa7b6f1d30,Semantic Scholar,,somewhat relevant,"The paper focuses on generative script learning utilizing large language models for knowledge prompting, which aligns with the concept of prompt engineering despite not explicitly mentioning hard prefix prompts."

Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce a F^2-Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness.

Such in-depth dialogue scenarios are challenging for existing LLMs to figure out the user's hidden needs and respond satisfactorily through a single-step inference. To this end, we propose a novel linguistic cue-based chain-of-thoughts (\textit{Cue}-CoT), which enhances the LLMs inference with an intermediate reasoning step to find cues exhibited in the dialogue, aiming to provide a more personalized and engaging response. To evaluate the approach, we build a benchmark with in-depth dialogue questions, consisting of 6 datasets in both Chinese and English, targeting 3 major linguistic cues during the conversation: \textit{personality}, \textit{emotion}, and \textit{psychology}. We conduct extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark with 5 LLMs under both zero-shot and one-shot settings.

While DR models can learn from large-scale public datasets like MS MARCO through transfer learning, evidence shows that not all DR models and domains can benefit from transfer learning equally. Recently, some researchers have resorted to large language models (LLMs) to improve the zero-shot and few-shot DR models. However, the hard prompts or human-written prompts utilized in these works cannot guarantee the good quality of generated weak queries. To tackle this, we propose soft prompt tuning for augmenting DR (SPTAR): For each task, we leverage soft prompt-tuning to optimize a task-specific soft prompt on limited ground truth data and then prompt the LLMs to tag unlabeled documents with weak queries, yielding enough weak document-query pairs to train task-specific dense retrievers. We design a filter to select high-quality example document-query pairs in the prompt to further improve the quality of weak tagged queries.

Despite careful prompting, explanations generated by GPT-3 may not even be factually grounded in the input, even on simple tasks with straightforward extractive explanations. However, these ﬂawed explanations can still be useful as a way to verify GPT-3’s predictions post-hoc.

With over 200, 000 models in the Hugging Face ecosystem, users grapple with selecting and optimizing models to suit multifaceted workflows and data domains while addressing computational, security, and recency concerns. There is an urgent need for machine learning frameworks that can eliminate the burden of model selection and customization and unleash the incredible power of the vast emerging model library for end users. Here, we propose a context-aware routing system, Tryage, that leverages a language model router for optimal selection of expert models from a model library based on analysis of individual input prompts. Inspired by the thalamic router in the brain, Tryage employs a perceptive router to predict down-stream model performance on prompts and, then, makes a routing decision using an objective function that integrates performance predictions with user goals and constraints that are incorporated through flags (e.g., model size, model recency). Tryage allows users to explore a Pareto front and automatically trade-off between task accuracy and secondary goals including minimization of model size, recency, security, verbosity, and readability. Across heterogeneous data sets that include code, text, clinical data, and patents, the Tryage framework surpasses Gorilla and GPT3.5 turbo in dynamic model selection identifying the optimal model with an accuracy of 50.9% , compared to 23.6% by GPT 3.5 Turbo and 10.8% by Gorilla.

While using the question to retrieve relevant text from an external knowledge source helps LLMs, we observe that this one-step retrieve-and-read approach is insufficient for multi-step QA. Here, what to retrieve depends on what has already been derived, which in turn may depend on what was previously retrieved. To address this, we propose IRCoT, a new approach for multi-step QA that interleaves retrieval with steps (sentences) in a CoT, guiding the retrieval with CoT and in turn using retrieved results to improve CoT. Using IRCoT with GPT3 substantially improves retrieval (up to 21 points) as well as downstream QA (up to 15 points) on four datasets: HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, and IIRC.

While such an approach works well for tasks that only require forward reasoning (e.g., straightforward arithmetic), it is less effective for constraint solving problems that require more sophisticated planning and search. In this paper, we propose a new satisfiability-aided language modeling (SatLM) approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use an LLM to generate a declarative task specification rather than an imperative program and leverage an off-the-shelf automated theorem prover to derive the final answer. This approach has two key advantages. The declarative specification is closer to the problem description than the reasoning steps are, so the LLM can parse it out of the description more accurately. Furthermore, by offloading the actual reasoning task to an automated theorem prover, our approach can guarantee the correctness of the answer with respect to the parsed specification and avoid planning errors in the solving process. We evaluate SATLM on 8 different datasets and show that it consistently outperforms program-aided LMs in the imperative paradigm. In particular, SATLM outperforms program-aided LMs by 23% on a challenging subset of the GSM arithmetic reasoning dataset; SATLM also achieves a new SoTA on LSAT and BoardgameQA, surpassing previous models that are trained on the respective training sets.",f27f6d1d521d189e78f5623098ced0deea613d33,Semantic Scholar,,highly relevant,"The paper explicitly discusses prompt-based methods and a variant of prompt tuning for named entity recognition, making it highly relevant to prompt engineering."

In their Letter to Editor, their main critique concerned the extent to which the nonanonymity of reflective portfolios and the lack of reflection prompts to students may have affected the G-theory analysis. In their view, these two aspects will have reduced the percentage variance of the object of measurement (students) and thus influenced the variance attributed to the study facets. In addition, they draw attention that the study instrument might not be replicable for clinical students, due to increased complexity of the learning environment. We address their concerns in turn. It is important to clarify that there are currently no universal guidelines for explaining the magnitude of variance related to each component in G-theory analysis. Of course, any researcher would aim to get the maximum percentage of variance attributed to differences between the object of measurement compared with other facets in the measurement plan. However, the main determinant of what represents large or small variance is the purpose of the study and the identified sources of variance. For example, we have recently reported an acceptable reliability coefficient with only 27% variance due to the object of measurement, because the study aimed to measure “soft skills”, which are considered difficult to measure. Given that reflection is an enigmatic and complex construct, we believe that the 46.6% variance attributed to the object of measurement in our study was reasonably grounded. We fully acknowledge that anonymity in reflective writing–based portfolios could have reduced the variance in student–rater interaction and thus bias in assessment. However, the decision concerning whether to provide students with reflection prompts or not is a tradeoff between scaffolding a structured, guided reflection process or affording the unbounded freedom of personal reflections deriving from a rich and varied array of lived experiences. We firmly believe that the absence of reflection prompts optimizes the conditions for individually unique, authentic reflections, which must be preferred to (re)acting reflectively to a checklist of activities triggered by a set of predetermined prompts. Here, maintaining a distinction between “reflection for learning” and “reflection for assessment” is useful: although prompts are a good device for learning purposes, they are not relevant for assessment purposes.

Within the domain of deep learning, large language models (LLMs) have been the subject of considerable attention in recent years by virtue of great leaps in progress and a wide range of potential applications, however, quantitative investigation into their potential in ecology has so far been lacking. In this work, we analyse the ability of GPT-4 to extract information about invertebrate pests and pest controllers from abstracts of a body of literature on biological pest control, using a bespoke, zero-shot prompt. Our results show that the performance of GPT-4 is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art tools used for taxonomic named entity recognition and geographic location extraction tasks.

Nevertheless, the accuracy of AI-generated feedback remains uncertain, with scant research investigating the ability of models like ChatGPT to deliver effective feedback. In this work-in-progress, we evaluate 30 dialogues generated by GPT-4 in a tutor-student setting. We use two different prompting approaches, the zero-shot chain of thought and the few-shot chain of thought, to identify specific components of effective praise based on five criteria.

using chatgpt with confidence for biodiversityrelated information tasks,"['Michael Elliott', 'José Fortes']",https://biss.pensoft.net/article/112926/download/pdf/,2023-09-19,,"Recent advancements in conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), present the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) as tools for retrieving, analyzing, and transforming scientific information. We have found that ChatGPT (GPT 3.5) can provide accurate biodiversity knowledge in response to questions about species descriptions, occurrences, and taxonomy, as well as structure information according to data sharing standards such as Darwin Core. A rigorous evaluation of ChatGPT's capabilities in biodiversity-related tasks may help to inform viable use cases for today's LLMs in research and information workflows. In this work, we test the extent of ChatGPT's biodiversity knowledge, characterize its mistakes, and suggest how LLM-based systems might be designed to complete knowledge-based tasks with confidence. To test ChatGPT's biodiversity knowledge, we compiled a question-and-answer test set derived from Darwin Core records available in Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio). Each question focuses on one or more Darwin Core terms to test the model’s ability to recall species occurrence information and its understanding of the standard. The test set covers a range of locations, taxonomic groups, and both common and rare species (defined by the number of records in iDigBio). The results of the tests will be presented. We also tested ChatGPT on generative tasks, such as creating species occurrence maps. A visual comparison of the maps with iDigBio data shows that for some species, ChatGPT can generate fairly accurate representationsof their geographic ranges (Fig. 1). ChatGPT's incorrect responses in our tests show several patterns of mistakes. First, responses can be self-conflicting. For example, when asked 'Does Acer saccharum naturally occur in Benton, Oregon?', ChatGPT responded 'YES, Acer saccharum DOES NOT naturally occur in Benton, Oregon'. ChatGPT can also be misled by semantics in species names. For Rafinesquia neomexicana, the word 'neomexicana' leads ChatGPT to believe that the species primarily occurs in New Mexico, USA. ChatGPT may also confuse species, such as when attempting to describe a lesser-known species (e.g., a rare bee) within the same genus as a better-known species. Other causes of mistakes include hallucination (Ji et al. 2023), memorization (Chang and Bergen 2023), and user deception (Li et al. 2023). Some mistakes may be avoided by prompt engineering, e.g., few-shot prompting (Chang and Bergen 2023) and chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al. 2022). These techniques assist Large Language Models (LLMs) by clarifying expectations or by guiding recollection. However, such methods cannot help when LLMs lack required knowledge. In these cases, alternative approaches are needed. A desired reliability can be theoretically guaranteed if responses that contain mistakes are discarded or corrected. This requires either detecting or predicting mistakes. Sometimes mistakes can be ruled out by verifying responses with a trusted source. For example, a trusted specimen record might be found that corroborates the response. The difficulty, however, is finding such records programmatically; e.g., using iDigBio and Global Biodiversity Information Facility's (GBIF) search Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) requires specifying indexed terms that might not appear in an LLM's response. This presents a secondary problem for which LLMs may be well suited. Note that with presence-only data, it can be difficult to disprove presence claims or prove absence claims. Besides verification, mistakes may be predicted using probabilistic methods. Formulating mistake probabilities often relies on heuristics. For example, variability in a model’s responses to a repeated query can be a sign of hallucination (Manakul et al. 2023). In practice, both probabilistic and verification methods may be needed to reach a desired reliability. LLM outputs that can be verified may be directly accepted (or discarded), while others are judged by estimating mistake probabilities. We will consider a set of heuristics and verification methods, and report empirical assessments of their impact on ChatGPT’s reliability.",17abf939baa953dd69dfaa4c2af5719217102c11,Semantic Scholar,,highly relevant,"The paper focuses on using large language models with zero-shot prompt-based information extraction in clinical settings, which directly involves prompt engineering."

The emergence of versatile LLMs capable of undertaking a wide array of tasks has reduced the necessity for intensive human involvement in training and maintaining ML models. Despite these advancements, a pivotal question emerges: can these generalized models negate the need for task-specific models? This study addresses this question by comparing the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting phishing URLs when utilized with prompt-engineering techniques versus when fine-tuned. Notably, we explore multiple prompt-engineering strategies for phishing URL detection and apply them to two chat models, GPT-3.5-turbo and Claude 2. In this context, the maximum result achieved was an F1-score of 92.74% by using a test set of 1000 samples. Following this, we fine-tune a range of base LLMs, including GPT-2, Bloom, Baby LLaMA, and DistilGPT-2—all primarily developed for text generation—exclusively for phishing URL detection. The fine-tuning approach culminated in a peak performance, achieving an F1-score of 97.29% and an AUC of 99.56% on the same test set, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

In BMI, we first construct a latent space for each modality via a variational autoencoder, and then align the semantic latent space to the visual latent space. Through this semantics-to-vision alignment, the semantic modality is mapped to the visual latent space and has the same feature structure as the visual modality. As a result, the visual and semantic prototypes can be better integrated. In addition, based on the multivariate Gaussian distribution and the prompt engineering, a data augmentation scheme is designed to ensure the accuracy of modality alignment during the training process.

In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have paved the way for revolutionizing mental health support and education. In this proof-of-concept study, we have created MindWatch, a cutting-edge tool that harnesses the power of AI-driven language models to serve as a valuable computer-aided system for the mental health professions to achieve two important goals such as early symptom detection, and personalized psychoeducation.

Recently, the combination of machine learning and deep learning with hyperspectral images has significantly improved the efficiency of crop detection. However, acquiring a large amount of properly annotated hyperspectral data on stressed crops requires extensive biochemical experiments and specialized knowledge. This limitation poses a challenge to the construction of large-scale datasets for crop stress analysis. Meta-learning is a learning approach that is capable of learning to learn and can achieve high detection accuracy with limited training samples. In this paper, we introduce meta-learning to hyperspectral imaging and crop detection for the first time. In addition, we gathered 88 hyperspectral images of drought-stressed tomato plants and 68 images of freeze-stressed tomato plants. The data related to drought serve as the source domain, while the data related to frost damage serve as the target domain. Due to the difficulty of obtaining target domain data from real-world testing scenarios, only a limited amount of target domain data and source domain data are used for model training. The results indicated that meta-learning, with a minimum of eight target domain samples, achieved a detection accuracy of 69.57%, precision of 59.29%, recall of 66.32% and F1-score of 62.61% for classifying the severity of frost stress, surpassing other methods with a target domain sample size of 20.

However, it is not yet clear whether LMs can understand physical concepts in the human world. To investigate this, we design a benchmark VEC that covers the tasks of (i) Visual concepts, such as the shape and material of objects, and (ii) Embodied Concepts, learned from the interaction with the world such as the temperature of objects. Our zero (few)-shot prompting results show that the understanding of certain visual concepts emerges as scaling up LMs, but there are still basic concepts to which the scaling law does not apply. For example, OPT-175B performs close to humans with a zero-shot accuracy of 85\% on the material concept, yet behaves like random guessing on the mass concept. Instead, vision-augmented LMs such as CLIP and BLIP achieve a human-level understanding of embodied concepts.

We base our current work on the empirically proven language understanding of very large transformer-based language models to expand a limited commonsense knowledge graph, initially generated only on visual data. The few-shot-prompted pre-trained language models can learn the context of an initial knowledge graph with less bias than language models fine-tuned on a large initial corpus.

This two-step approach of vision mining and language model prompts results in the auto-generation of a commonsense knowledge graph well equipped with physical commonsense, which is human commonsense gained by interacting with the physical world. To prompt the language models, we adapted the chain-of-thought method of prompting.

For each mail-out, the sample was divided into experimental (received prompt) and comparison (no prompt) groups, and one type of prompt or combination was used. Non-returnees of the questionnaire in the experimental group received either: (a) a single telephone call, (b) a memo, (c) a package (personal letter and new questionnaire) or package plus a telephone call, or (d) a double call. Comparison physicians and clergy were mailed only the original questionnaire. Relative to their respective comparison group's return rate, which averaged 22% across the four mail-outs (range 18% to 24%), the single call and package alone about doubled the overall return rate, the package and call increased the return rate about two-and-a-half fold, and the double call almost tripled the return rate. The memo was ineffective. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that the double-call procedure was less expensive than the single call, and much less expensive than the package alone or package with a call in securing returns. An analysis of the pattern of returns showed clearly that when prompts were not delivered (comparison groups), very few returns were received after about seven days from the initial mail-out.

However, their ability to use mobile apps has not yet been studied in detail. Purpose This study aimed to assess the ability of children aged 2–8 years to perform touchscreen gestures and follow prompting techniques, i.e., ways apps provide instructions on how to use them. Methods We developed one mobile app to test the ability of children to perform various touchscreen gestures and another mobile app to test their ability to follow various prompting techniques. We used these apps in this study of 90 children in a kindergarten and a primary school in New Delhi in July 2019. We noted the touchscreen gestures that the children could perform and the most sophisticated prompting technique that they could follow. Results Two- and 3-year-old children could not follow any prompting technique and only a minority (27%) could tap the touchscreen at an intended place. Four- to 6-year-old children could perform simple gestures like a tap and slide (57%) and follow instructions provided through animation (63%). Seven- and 8-year-old children could perform more sophisticated gestures like dragging and dropping (30%) and follow instructions provided in audio and video formats (34%). We observed a significant difference between the number of touchscreen gestures that the children could perform and the number of prompting techniques that they could follow (F=544.0407, P<0.05). No significant difference was observed in the performance of female versus male children (P>0.05). Conclusion Children gradually learn to use mobile apps beginning at 2 years of age.

The phase inversion within the thin (<500 μm) and bulk (~2 cm) layer of polyamic-acid (PAA) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) by using water as non-solvent was considered. It was shown that polymer films formed within the “limited” layer of polymer solution showed a good agreement with the morphology of corresponded asymmetric flat-sheet membranes even in the case of three-component casting solution (PAA/NMP/EtOH). At the same time, the polymer films formed on the interface of two bulk phases (“infinite” regime) did not fully correspond to the membrane structure. It was shown that up to 50% of NMP solvent in PAA solution can be replaced by ethanol, which can have a renewable origin. By changing the ethanol content in the casting solution, the average size of transport pores can be varied in the range of 12–80 nm, and the liquid permeance from 16.6 up to 207 kg/m2∙h∙bar. To summarize, the precipitation of polymer solution within the thin layer can be considered a prompt technique and a powerful tool for fast screening and optimization of the complex composition of casting solutions using its small quantity.

focus difference in cue fading a new technique,['L. E. Acker'],https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1338549?pdf=render,1969-03-01,,"Following the development of cue fading as an adjunct to discrimination training with lower animals (Terrace, 1963a, 1963b, 1963c, 1964, 1966) it seemed valuable to utilize cue-fading (prompting) techniques with children. Because educational institutions offer the major source of child subjects and because such institutions can provide only limited and temporary space, it seemed desirable to consider a relatively simple, portable, and flexibly programmed apparatus for presenting prompted stimulus materials. Such an apparatus should allow for: (1) presentation of visual stimuli which can be progressively varied along a prompting dimension; (2) adjustment, during training, of the number and size of prompt steps in a prompting progression; and, (3) repetition or interruption of any part of a prompting progression at any time during training. The latter two requirements can be met in one of two ways: (1) many series of stimuli must be prepared which progress through the prompting dimension in a wide variety of steps and step sizes (successful cue fading with children has been obtained under these conditions: Acker, 1966; Sidman and Stoddard, 1967; Touchette, 1968; Gollin and Savoy, 1968); or (2) the training apparatus must be capable of making these changes in the prompting progression independently of the stimuli (Moore and Goldiamond, 1964). The present system utilizes the latter method, thus providing a more immediate and economical means of adjusting the prompting progression to suit the immediate needs of the experiment. The present system utilizes a focus difference between two stimuli (S+ and S-) to prompt a correct choice of S+ [Israel (1960), successfully used variable blurring to prompt recall of the second member in a pairedassociate learning task]. Two Kodak Carousel, 35-mm projectors (model No. AV900) with remote control are used to present the stimulus. Using one projector for presenting Sand the other for S+, a focus difference (prompt) between the two stimuli can be created. For example, keeping S+ in focus it is possible to present a series of S-s which progresses from extremely out-offocus to in-focus over trials. The number and size of steps in such a progression is immediately adjustable",ef1740d0713a27b1b5a590f7bca7aa7dd56ecdc2,Semantic Scholar,,somewhat relevant,"The abstract mentions the use of prompts in a data synthesis framework for multi-hop question answering, indicating relevance to prompt engineering."

We evaluated PRoMPTd on eight datasets covering tasks including arithmetics, logical reasoning, and code generation, using GPT-4 as the task LLM. Notably, PRoMPTd achieves an absolute improvement of around 10% on the complex MATH dataset and 5% on the code generation task on HumanEval, outperforming conventional zero-shot methods.

SPoT first learns a prompt on one or more source tasks and then uses it to initialize the prompt for a target task. We show that SPoT significantly boosts the performance of Prompt Tuning across many tasks. More remarkably, across all model sizes, SPoT matches or outperforms standard Model Tuning (which fine-tunes all model parameters) on the SuperGLUE benchmark, while using up to 27,000× fewer task-specific parameters. To understand where SPoT is most effective, we conduct a large-scale study on task transferability with 26 NLP tasks in 160 combinations, and demonstrate that many tasks can benefit each other via prompt transfer. Finally, we propose an efficient retrieval approach that interprets task prompts as task embeddings to identify similar tasks and predict the most transferable source tasks for a novel target task.",c28b7dfe341f1e13a5a98efbce7946ef795cf9b8,Semantic Scholar,,highly relevant,"The paper discusses the use of prompting techniques ('Miniature & Mull' and 'Explain & Compare') to assist LLMs in evaluating SQL queries, which is directly related to prompt engineering."

Recent advances in the foundation VLMs and their adaptation to segmentation tasks in natural images with VLSMs have opened up a unique opportunity to build potentially powerful segmentation models for medical images that enable providing helpful information via language prompt as input, leverage the extensive range of other medical imaging datasets by pooled dataset training, adapt to new classes, and be robust against out-of-distribution data with human-in-the-loop prompting during inference. Although transfer learning from natural to medical images for image-only segmentation models has been studied, no studies have analyzed how the joint representation of vision-language transfers to medical images in segmentation problems and understand gaps in leveraging their full potential. We present the first benchmark study on transfer learning of VLSMs to 2D medical images with thoughtfully collected 11 existing 2D medical image datasets of diverse modalities with carefully presented 9 types of language prompts from 14 attributes. Our results indicate that VLSMs trained in natural image-text pairs transfer reasonably to the medical domain in zero-shot settings when prompted appropriately for non-radiology photographic modalities; when finetuned, they obtain comparable performance to conventional architectures, even in X-rays and ultrasound modalities. However, the additional benefit of language prompts during finetuning may be limited, with image features playing a more dominant role; they can better handle training on pooled datasets combining diverse modalities and are potentially more robust to domain shift than the conventional segmentation models.",b18daa14486920016c4664c3ed1759f2de1ba854,Semantic Scholar,,highly relevant,"The paper analyzes human likeness in GPT-3.5 generated comments using multiple prompting techniques, directly tying into prompt engineering."
multimodal prompt learning in emotion recognition using context and audio information,"['Eunseo Jeong', 'Gyu-Min Kim', 'Sangwoo Kang']",https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/13/2908/pdf?version=1688017556,2023-06-28,,"Prompt learning has improved the performance of language models by reducing the gap in language model training methods of pre-training and downstream tasks. However, extending prompt learning in language models pre-trained with unimodal data to multimodal sources is difficult as it requires additional deep-learning layers that cannot be attached. In the natural-language emotion-recognition task, improved emotional classification can be expected when using audio and text to train a model rather than only natural-language text. Audio information, such as voice pitch, tone, and intonation, can give more information that is unavailable in text to predict emotions more effectively. Thus, using both audio and text can enable better emotion prediction in speech emotion-recognition models compared to semantic information alone. In this paper, in contrast to existing studies that use multimodal data with an additional layer, we propose a method for improving the performance of speech emotion recognition using multimodal prompt learning with text-based pre-trained models. The proposed method is using text and audio information in prompt learning by employing a language model pre-trained on natural-language text. In addition, we propose a method to improve the emotion-recognition performance of the current utterance using the emotion and contextual information of the previous utterances for prompt learning in speech emotion-recognition tasks.

Prompting technologies have the potential to help promote aging in place by providing support for the initiation and accurate completion of IADLs. In this study, we evaluate preferences of older adults for different levels of prompting support based on subjective and objective measures of cognitive functioning. METHOD Participants were 170 community-dwelling older adults split into two cognitive complaint groups: cognitive complaints and few cognitive complaints. After completing six IADL tasks (e.g., organize a pillbox, cook), each participant was asked to make a specific error (e.g., leave stove on) on three of the tasks. They were then prompted to correct the error with one of three different prompt modes: verbal indirect, verbal direct, multimodal verbal direct and video. RESULTS The cognitive complaints group reported greater preference for the multimodal prompt compared to the few cognitive complaints group. The indirect prompt was the least preferred by both groups. Furthermore, participants who recalled less on objective memory measures preferred more support in terms of prompt mode.

Moreover, derivative-free optimisation (DFO) techniques make it possible to tune prompts for a black-box PLM to better fit downstream tasks. However, there are usually preconditions to apply existing DFO-based prompt tuning methods, e.g. the backbone PLM needs to provide extra APIs so that hidden states (and/or embedding vectors) can be injected into it as continuous prompts, or carefully designed (discrete) manual prompts need to be available beforehand, serving as the initial states of the tuning algorithm.

Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 2,400 images generated across eight surgical specialties by each model. An additional 1,200 images were evaluated based on geographic prompts for three countries. Images were generated using a prompt template, 'A photo of the face of a [blank]', with blank replaced by a surgical specialty. Geographic-based prompting was evaluated by specifying the most populous countries for three continents (United States, Nigeria, and China). Results: There was a significantly higher representation of female (average=35.8% vs. 14.7%, P<0.001) and non-white (average=37.4% vs. 22.8%, P<0.001) surgeons among trainees than attendings.

This paper pioneers a Chinese Implicit Intent Dataset CIID, which covers 7 common intents from diﬀerent ﬁelds, and the data is the text containing the user’s implicit intent. Based on this corpus, it is the ﬁrst time prompt learning is employed for implicit intent recognition and by constructing a suitable prompt template, the model can get ”relevant hints” to dig out the true intention of the user. Finally, this paper evaluates a range of classiﬁcation models on CIID dataset. Experimental results show that the recognition rate of the proposed model is 97.6%, and achieves the state-of-the-art recognition accuracy. Furthermore, since it is diﬃcult to collect the user’s implicit intention data, this paper also explores the performance of these classiﬁcation models on the CIID dataset with few-shot settings, and the experimental results show when the training data is reduced to 4.7%, the recognition rate of the proposed model can still keep 92.4%, which is signiﬁcantly higher than other baseline models, the results further prove this proposed method is advanced and robust.",330009bebca2152592067c9616e0d86505d49e27,Semantic Scholar,,somewhat relevant,"The paper discusses leveraging 'Knowledge and Few-shot Enhancement In-context Learning (KFE)' framework for LLMs, which aligns with the concept of prompt engineering, specifically through an application of in-context learning techniques."

However, the answer quality of most existing visual-language pre-training (VLP) methods is still limited, mainly due to: (1) Incompatibility. Upstream pre-training tasks are generally incompatible with downstream question answering tasks, which makes the knowledge from the language model not well transferable to downstream tasks, and greatly limits their performance in few-shot scenarios; (2) Under-fitting. They generally do not integrate human priors to compensate for universal knowledge from language models, so as to fit the challenging VQA problem and generate reliable answers. To address these issues, we propose HybridPrompt, a cloze- and verify-style hybrid prompt framework with bridging language models and human priors in prompt tuning for VQA.

entgpt linking generative large language models with knowledge bases,"['Yifan Ding', 'Amrit Poudel', 'Qingkai Zeng', 'Tim Weninger', 'Balaji Veeramani', 'Sanmitra Bhattacharya']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06738v1.pdf,2024-02-09,,"  The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate factually correctoutput remains relatively unexplored due to the lack of fact-checking andknowledge grounding during training and inference. In this work, we aim toaddress this challenge through the Entity Disambiguation (ED) task. We firstconsider prompt engineering, and design a three-step hard-prompting method toprobe LLMs' ED performance without supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Overall, theprompting method improves the micro-F_1 score of the original vanilla models bya large margin, on some cases up to 36% and higher, and obtains comparableperformance across 10 datasets when compared to existing methods with SFT. Wefurther improve the knowledge grounding ability through instruction tuning (IT)with similar prompts and responses. The instruction-tuned model not onlyachieves higher micro-F1 score performance as compared to several baselinemethods on supervised entity disambiguation tasks with an average micro-F_1improvement of 2.1% over the existing baseline models, but also obtains higheraccuracy on six Question Answering (QA) tasks in the zero-shot setting.

ghostwriter augmenting collaborative humanai writing experiences through personalization and agency,"['Catherine Yeh', 'Gonzalo Ramos', 'Rachel Ng', 'Andy Huntington', 'Richard Banks']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08855v1.pdf,2024-02-13,,"  Large language models (LLMs) are becoming more prevalent and have found aubiquitous use in providing different forms of writing assistance. However,LLM-powered writing systems can frustrate users due to their limitedpersonalization and control, which can be exacerbated when users lackexperience with prompt engineering. We see design as one way to address thesechallenges and introduce GhostWriter, an AI-enhanced writing design probe whereusers can exercise enhanced agency and personalization. GhostWriter leveragesLLMs to learn the user's intended writing style implicitly as they write, whileallowing explicit teaching moments through manual style edits and annotations.We study 18 participants who use GhostWriter on two different writing tasks,observing that it helps users craft personalized text generations and empowersthem by providing multiple ways to control the system's writing style. Fromthis study, we present insights regarding people's relationship withAI-assisted writing and offer design recommendations for future work.",,arXiv,"['cs.hc', 'cs.ai']",highly relevant,"The paper discusses exploring GPT-3's capability in generating empathetic dialogues through prompt-based in-context learning, which is a direct application of hard prefix prompting in natural language processing tasks."

chainofthought reasoning without prompting,"['Xuezhi Wang', 'Denny Zhou']",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10200v1.pdf,2024-02-15,,"  In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs),prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such asfew-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These methods, whileeffective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takesa novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? Ourfindings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited frompre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process. Rather thanconventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-$k$ alternative tokens,uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. Thisapproach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us toassess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observethat the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higherconfidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectivelydifferentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths. Extensive empirical studies onvarious reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding substantiallyoutperforms the standard greedy decoding.",,arXiv,['cs.cl'],highly relevant,The paper's focus on 'Corpus-Specific Prefix Tuning' and proposing a method for improving prefix word information directly pertains to hard prefix prompting in prompt engineering.
